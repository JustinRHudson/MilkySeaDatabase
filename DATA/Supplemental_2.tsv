It has been remaked by feveral navigators, on their paffage from Mocha to Bombay, Surat, &c. that they had difcovered in the night fpots of water as white a milk, and could never affign any reafon for it; and many have been fo much alarmed, that they have immediately hove to and founded; but I never heard of any body ever getting ground. In my paffage acrofs thofe feas in the Kelfall, I difcovered all of a fudden, about 8 o'clock in the evening, the water all round me as white as milk (intermixt with ftreaks of ferpentine lines of black water). I immediately drew a bucket of it and carried it to the light, where it appeared juft as other water; I drew feveral more, and found it the fame: fome I kept till the next morning, when I could perceive no difference from that alongfide. We had run by the log 50 min. from the time we firft obferved it till daylight, and during all that time the water continued white as milk, but at full daylight it was of its ufual colour. The next evening about 7 o'clock the water appeared again as white as before; I then drew another bucket and carried it to a very dark place, and holding my head clofe to the bucket could perceived, with my naked eye, an immumerable quantity of animalcules floating about alive, which enlightened that fmall body of water to an amazing degree. From thence I conclude that the whole mafs of water muft be filled with this fmall fifh fpawn or animalcules, and that this is without all doubt the reafon of the water's appearing fo white in the night-time. We run by the log, from the tiem we firft faw it till the latter part of the fecond night (the time we loft fight of it) about 170 miles. N.B.

01/30/1777	(?)	02/03/1777	(?)	16 deg 00' N	59 deg 00' E	(?)	Johan Splinter Stavornius	On the 30th, we met, at night, with a very fingular appearance in the colour of the fea. It affumed fo great a degree of whitenefs, that it was perfectly like milk. During the day, we had obferved that the water was darker and browner than ufual, and had loft that azure clearnefs which it almoft always has in the open fea: in proportion as the evening twilight diminifhed, it became whiter, and encreafed gradually in whitenefs till nine o'clock, when it was fo white, that the whole fea appeared as if covered with a white fheet, or exactly like the appearance, in the night-time, of a flat country overfpread with fnow. The horizon was not diftinguifhable, except to the northweft, where the line of diftinction between the fea and the fky was difcernable, from the latter being fomewhat dark and gloomy. This phenomenon was entirely diftinct from the luminous appearance which if frequently obferved in the water of the ocean, as, inftead of giving any light, the whole was a deadly palenefs, excepting clofe to the veffel, where it feemed mixed with fome fparks of light. While it was the ftrongest, I had the lead caft feveral times, but we found no ground with a line of one hundred and fifty fathoms. I had fome of the water taken up, and examined it directly with the microfcope, but could not fee anything in it, with a glafs of the greateft magnifying powers; to the naked eye, it appeared as clear as crystal; and on, tafting it, it feemed to have loft fomething of its briny and bituminous tafte. The fame appearance was obferved by the Englifh captain Newland, in the fame part of the ocean, with the difference, however, that he faw it intermixed with black ftripes running in a ferpentine direction through the whitenefs, which I did not fee in it. He likewife difcovered animalculae in it, by putting a glafs, with fome of the water, in a dark place, and holding his hand clofe over it; but neither did I obferve any thing of this kind, although I likewife filled a glafs with the water, and put it in a dark place, but without holding my hand over it. The account given of this phenomenon by Mr. Nuberk, volume ii, page 84 and 85, agrees perfectly with the above. About midnight, when the moon rofe, the water refumed, by degrees, its former dufky colour, and on the following morning it appeared the fame as the day before. We were then, by eftimation, fixty leagues from the coaft of Arabia Felix, which was the neareft land. Our north latitude was 16 deg, and our compaffed fhewed a northweft-erly variation of five degrees. We had a light breeze of wind, chiefly from the northeaftm, varying, however, from E.N.E. to N.N.E.; the thermometer ftood at 72 deg; the fky was, in general, flightly clouded; and the ftars were vifible: i had no reafon to fuppofe that the moon had any influence upon this phenomenon, or had contributed to it, it having been in the quarter the day before; and the more; as we did not difcover any ftrong current. I remember to have read fomewhere in Valentyn, that this fame appearance is alfo fometimes obferved in the feas between Amboyna and Banda; but I am well affured that it would never be more diftinctly feen than when I obferved it. On the following evening, and part of the night, we faw this phenomenon again, and every night till the 3d of February, but in a flighter degree every fucceeding time, and on the evening after that day, it was not vifible at all; there was however, a ftrong luminous appearance in the water; we were then, by efitmation, thirty-five leagues from the neareft part of Arabia Felix, being in the north latitude of 17 deg 30', and our compaffes ftill fhewing a northwefterly variation of five degrees. During the time we faw this white water, the fky was fometimes entirely clear, with a fine ftarlight down to the very horizon, and fometimes it was cloudy, and even quite overcaft; fo that it does not appear to me that the ftate of the weather had any influence upon it: the themometer continued, for the moft part, at the point at which it was the firft evening.

08/22/1832	07:45 LOC	08/22/1832	(?)	21 deg 40' N	59 deg 40' E	H. C. Clive	(?)	During a passage from Bombay to the Persian Gulf, on board the H. C. sloop Clive, on the 22nd August, 1832, at a quarter before eight o'clock at night, a phenomenon appeared of the following nature, and to all on board of an unheard-of kind, which gave rise to transitory feelings of apprehension as to the vessel's contiguity to danger. Sailing under double-reefer topsails and fore sail at the rate of nine and a half miles per hour, before a strong S W. monsoon wind and a high sea, without any indication of a change in the elements, the ship was surrounder instanter by water as white as milk or snow; it seemed to have no termination until it reached an altitude of 75 deg or 80 deg, where it subsided in a strongly marked ecliptic, above which the heavens presented a beautiful and bright bluish cast, not dissimilar to polished steel. No line of horizon was visible; the dead white colour of the water close to the ship as it increased in distance from her very gradually brightened until, where I supposed the horizon to be, it assumed a silvery aspect, which increasing as it ascended became brilliant and dazzling towards the zenith, obscuring the stars and clouds which had before this visitation been distinctly visible. The sea in a moment became smooth, the ship, from rolling and labouring considerably, quite steady; no diminution in the wind occurred, but a sensation that it had fallen even to a calm was general, but momentary. The delusion was occasioned by the instantaneous steadiness of the vessel, as well as the vessation of the previous noise from the lashing of a mountainous and confused sea against the vessel's sides and on her decks; her progress through the sea, howevr closely scrutinized, could not be observed; the disturbed water alongside and in her wake, as well as the foam around her bows, did not contrast with the adjoining unagitated fluid, not withstanding from the velocity of the ship through the water these must have been considerable. Not a particle of phosphoric matter was once observable, either in the surrounding ocean or in the water immediately displaced by the ship's passage through it; but when taken up in a bucket and agitated with the hand, such was visible, but not in a greater proportion than is usual, nor did the water vary in appearance from common sea-water; nothing could be perceived to attribute this strange phenomenon to. Animalcules of a minute kind were perceptible, as likewise a few pieces of glutinous susbtance of a purple colour, but neither in any considerable quantity, nor differing from what is usually found in the seas of the Indian Ocean. We sailed the distance of fifteen miles without the slightest change in the appearance of the sea or sky, when in a moment this extraordinary phenomenon vanished, the ship at the same instant encountering the like high and turbulent sea as previous to her envelopment. The ship was not within one hundred miles of the eastern coast of Arabia or of soundings, but sailing in what is termed deep ocean water. I have before mentioned that the ship was quite steady during her progress through the white water; this was the case, with the exception that in a few instances she gave a heavy roll as if influenced by a following swell; these were not more frequent than once in a quarter of an hour. Latitude 21 deg 40 N., long 59 deg 40 E.; therm 87 deg, bar. 29. 09. The phenomenon I have attempted to describe appeared twice after we were first extricated from it, for periods of about twenty minutes; its brilliancy as well as influence over the waves as previously described; the transition from high and mountainous seas to a smooth and seemingly quite ocean, and change again to turbulence, was as sudden as a flash of lightning. On my arrival at Muscat, a few days after, I endeavoured to gain some information on the foregoing matter; but beyond finding that the phenomenon was occasionally met during the S W. monsoon, about the limit noted, and that the water was then quite fresh, I could ascertain nothing satisfactory. My informants were the Nakodas, or captains of H.H. the Imaum's ships of war, who frequently navigated between Muscat and Zanzibar, consequently must pass about the spot the Clive met what i have related. The Arab Captains were firm in their assertion in the particulars of the fresh water, although they confessed that they had never tasted it. I had, as also the surgeon of the vessel, and, as I mentioned before, it did not vary in any way from ordinary sea-water.

01/25/1849	18:30 LOC	01/26/1840	(?)	16 deg 13' N	61 deg 51' E	Moozuffer	Kempthorne, Captain	Moozuffer, 25th January, 1849.--I cannot permit this opportunity to pass by without describing to you, in the best way I am able, a most extraordinary phenomenon which we all witnessed on the night of the 23rd instant. It would indeed require a far abler and more scientific pen than mine to do justice to it--however, I hope you will take the will for the deed, and pardon all imperfections. At 6.30 p.m. observed a very remarkable milky appearance in the water, the colour assuming the same ting as a shallow mud-bank or sand bank. The sea, which had, a few minutes before, been turbulent and confused, suddenly became smooth and placid, and the air felt cold and chilly. In the space of an hour the whole verge of the horizon, as far as the eye could reach, was most brilliantly illumiated. The vessel shortly after entered a vast body of water of the most dazzling brightness, and of highly phosphoresent nature; in fact it looked as if we were sailing over a boundless plain of snow, or a sea of quicksilver. The surface of the ocean for miles in extent was unbroken-not a wave or rippe disturbed it, and the waters seemed so dense and solid, that the Moozuffer actually appeared as if she was forcing her way through molten lead. That part of the surface which was broken by the stroke of our huge paddle-wheels resembled small patches of thick milk or cream. The sky and everything around us was quite lighted up by it. The weather was particularly fine, though the atmosphere was damp and moist: the wind was light from the N.W., stars overhead clear and light, but those of a lesser altitude were rendered dim by a haze. The horizon nearly the whole time was dark and ill-defined; a few thin cumuli, floating very low down, occasionally swept past; but no other peculiarity in the atmosphere could be perceived until about ten o'clock, when a singular light was seen in the heavens to the northward, as if day was dawning or the full moon was either setting or just rising. It strongly resembled a faint Aurora Borealis, being of a roseate tinge near the horizon, and was a steady fixed light, but without those corruscations which are usually observed in the higher latitudes. It extended along the horizon in the form of a segment of a circle from N.W. to N.E., and the altitude of the centre of the arch was 15 deg. It continued visible until a sew minutes after midnight, when it disappeared as suddenly as it appeared, and the sea about the same period lost also its luminous quality. The light in the heavens and the lightness of the sea were, however, again seen for about ten minutes at 2 a.m., when both became  once more invisible. The horizon, except where the light appeared, was everywhere dark and indistinct, and could not be made out: the sky and sea were apparently blended together. The phenomena was altogether as beautiful as it was extraordinary. I could have stood on the deck gazing at it the whole night, and should not have felt fatigued. There was something grand and sublime in such a scene as I have faintly endeavoured to pourtray. No language of mine could ever do justice to it. We were upwards of six hours in passing thorugh this vast body of luminous water, and during that time we ran a distance of upwards of forty miles. Our lat. on first entering it was 16 deg 13 S., and long. 61 deg 51 E., so that our position was exactly abreast of the entrance to the Persian Gulf, and in the fair channel to the Red Sea. From the fact of our having seen immense quantities of sea-weed floaitng past whilst in this luminous water, I should conclude the accumulation of this and other decayed matter, whether vegetable or animalculae, was the sole cause of this phosphorescent appearance; and that all this matter might have been swept out of those narrow seas by strong currents which meet no doubt about this spot: and I am still more inclined to believe this is the case, as a luminous stream of water has often been noticed nearly in the same lat. and long. and about the sea season of the year. I saw it once in the Victoria when I commanded her, in the month of January, 1842, whilst on our voyage from Aden to Bombay; but the sea was not nearly so bright then as this time. The colour of the water so strongly resembled a shoal that I stopped the engines, and took several casts of the lead but could get no bottom with eighty fatomes of line. Several buckets of water were drawn up by Dr. Wilson, of the Moozuffer, but nothing whatever could be seen. It seemed as clear as crystal: on taking a bottle of it, however, in the dark, it became highly phosphorescent, giving out a strong lgiht. It was full of animalculae: some were in the shape of most minute globules of gelatinous substance, and others were not unlike small worms about an inch in length and about the size of a fine hair. On removing the bottle to the light, the animalculae became instantly invisible. The light seen in the heavens I cannot account for, unless it was the low fleecy clouds which hung on the verge of the horizon that reflected back the brightness of the sea; but why the whole sky should not have assumed the same appearance, I cannot imagine. it continued to shine in one spot only, and disappeared at the same time the sea lost its brilliancy. I send you an extract of the log, in which the luminous appearance in the sea and heavens is noticed:--' at 6.30 p.m., passing through an illuminated sea: the sea also became suddenly smooth, with queantities of sea-weed floating by. At 10 an extraordinary luminous appearance to the northward, as that of a full moon rising or setting: the water of a thick white; with a very dark horizon: wind N.W.--hazy blue sky, with passing clouds.'

No. II. 1854, p. 206) that you solicit further notices of such phenomena as Capt. Bowen has given you on the preceding page. Accordingly I send you the following copy of notes taken immediately after witnessing the phenomena they describe. Ship 'Shooting Star' bound from N.Y. to Hong Kong, Thursday, July 27th, 1854. Lat. 11 deg 27 N.[should read S. not N., this is known from another account aboard this ship during the same night.]; Long 105 deg 40 E. 7 3/4 P.M. A little cloudy on the horizon, but very clear bright starlight, fresh breeze. Air 73 deg F. Ship entered light-colored water, and in about 15 minutes the sea as far as the eye could reach appeared like an immense field of snow, no ripples, but smooth like oil, so that when the ship's bows threw up a ripple it immediately fell back to its former level. Orders were given to heave the lead, when 60 fathoms found no bottom. The light from the water illuminated objects on deck and dimmed all stars within 20 deg of the horizon. Looking over the widest part of it, the horizon appeared like a dim Aurora Borealis. Ship's head North, sailed 10 miles through this patch, then 1/2 a mile through ordinary colored seawater, and again through another patch of 10 miles of light water: limits of light water well defined. Dipped up deck a tup full of this water, and found it 78 1/2 deg, same as water in the morning. The tub presented a brilliant sight, being filled with bright self-luminous serpentine animalculae, varying from half an inch to five inches in length. Examined carefully in the hand, by the light, they were found to be nearly transparent, about the size of a hair in the middle, and tapering a little towards each end; [???] a jelly-like substance which burnt in the candle with a red light, and cripsed like burnt whalebone. A few were differently formed. Two were found capable of propelling themselves through still water in a tumbler. One of thse was in the form of concentri ring half an inch in diameter, with teeth-like projections on the inner-edge, and seemed to propel itself by contracting the diameter of the ring: it was preserved alive abut 36 hours. This examination satisfied me that the light is emitted by animalculae,but I am most anxious to know if scientific men can expalin why it appears at certain times and within such prescribed limits.

The sea was the color of milk, as far as the eye could reach. The paddles, or the rudder even, did not discolor it, nor turn up a single point of the luminous phosphorescence with which the ship's path had been marked for several preceding nights. Captain Baby mentioned that patches and streaks of this "milky sea" he had occasionally seen, but never anything of the sort on so large a scale before. On drawing up a bucket-full of water, it presented no unusual appearance; under a powerful glass, however, it was found to be all alive with animalculae. The cause of the phenomenon was presumed, or rather, guessed, to be a great abundance of whale feed, which convenient theory is not necessarily a very definite or exclusive one.

Captain Trébuchet states that on the night of August 26th, 1860, while tacking to reach Amboyna, lying at about twenty miles E.N.E., he and his crew witnessed the curious spectacle of the Milky Sea, which the Dutch call the Winter Sea, because both the sky and the waters present the apearance of fields covered with snow. The phenomenon lasted from seven p.m. until the return of daylight. They at first attributed it to the reflection of the moon, then only three days old; but, as the appearance continued after the moon had set, this explanation had to be discarded. A bucketful of sea water being drawn up and being and examined, it was found to contain about 200 groups of animalculae of the same thickness (that of a hair) but of different lengths, varying between one and two-tenths of a millimétre, and adhering to each other by tens and twenties, like strings of beads. These insects emitted a fixed liuht similar to that of the firefly or glow-worm; and it was admitted on all hands that the white appearance of the sea could only be attributed to these minute creatures, the numbers of which must therefore exceed all imagination.

(...) The patch was extensive. We were several hours running through it. Around the horizon there was a subdued glare, or flush, as though there were a distant illumination going on, whilst overhead there was a lurid, dark sky, in which the stars paled. The whole face of nature seemed changed, and with but little stretch of the imagination, the Alabama might have been conceived to be a phantom ship, lighted up by the sickly and unearthly glare of a phantom sea, and gliding on under the pale stars one knew not whither.

Jan Lels	Naar aanleiding van het door den Heer N. van Wyck Jurriaanse medegedeelde over de waterverkleuring bij Socotra, laat ik volgen een extract uit mijn dagboek, gehouden op eene reis met een zeilschip naar Soerabaya. 30 Aug. 1869. Heden 12 uur waren wij op 12 gr 11' Z.B. en 113 gr 48' O.L. Wij maakten op de achtermiddag en platvoetwachten naar gissing totaal 14 mijl en bevonden ons des avonds 7 uur op 11 gr 20' Z. Br., daar wij steeds N. t. O. hadden gestuurd. Juist waren wij gereed met schasten, toen de kapitein, die reeds aan dek was, door de kerkkap waarschuwde, dat het witte water vooruit zichtbaar was. Ik had over dit verschijnsel door den kapitein en stuuman dikwijls hooren spreken, doch zij zelven hadden het zoo zelden gezien, dat ik niet had durven hopen, het juist op deze reis waar te nemen. Aan dek gekomen zag ik, dat het water verkleurd was, even alsof het met melk vermenge ware. Langzamerhand werd het witter, totdat het na verloop van tiem minuten juist was, alsof wij door melk voeren, terwijl het schuim op de koppen der golven niet meer te onderscheiden was. De lucht was betrokken en scheen, in tegenstelling van het onmetelijke melkwiite vlak der ons omringende zee, nog dubbel zoo donker. Aan dek was het licht en kon men zonder moeite lezen. Ik liet met de boegpomp een puts met water vullen en ofschoon dit niet zoo wit van kleur leek als de zee, bemerkte ik toch dat het krioelde van kleine lichtende lichaampjes, die zich snel bewogen. Vermoedende, dat doot het pompen vele dier lichaampjes zich aan den binnenwand van zuigbuis en pomp hadden vastgehect, wilde ik op het achterdek een puts water opslaan, toen ons van het voorschip werd toegeroepen om haast te maken, daar men op een afstand duidelijk de scheiding van het witte water kon zien. Voor wij dan ook den tijd hadden het water op te slaan, waren wij de scheiding gepasseerd en vertoonde de zee zich aanmerkelijk donkerder van kleur. In het water dat toen nog werd opgeslagen, bevonden zich nog duidenden lichtgevende voorweprjes. Achteruit ziende, deed zich de scheiding als een recht elijn van het Westen naar het Oosten voor. Het schip liep 8 mijl en daar wij +/- een half uur lang door het witte water waren gezeild, moet dit ter plaatse ongeveer 4 Eng. mijl breed zijn geweest.

Last February the French Ironclad L'Armide passed through a considerable stretch of milky phosphorescenct sea between Point de Galle and Aden. Lieutenant Pornain reports that the nights of February 9, 10, 12, and 13 were characterized by the phenomenon in all its splendor, the ship during this tiem traversing 660 miles (1,100 kilometers) in a mean latitude of 12 deg north, between the meridians of 61 deg and 51 deg east longitude. There was no thunderstorm, the sky was clear, the moon new, the barometer, thermometer, and hygrometer were regular, and a gentle northeast monsoon was blowing. The temperature of the surface of the water was constant at 25 deg. The sea was like a snow covered field in a clear night, and all traces of undulations were lost sight of. The milky look was hardly disturbed by the motion of the ship and working of the screw (which shows that the layer had considerable thickness). By day all disappeared; but the hue of the sea was somewhat altered. Looked at attentively over the ship's side at night the water was seen to contain an enormous number of luminous particles pressed close together, and more brilliant close to the side (where disturbed). Some four hundreds of these corpuscles, one to two centimeters long, could be counted in a bucket holding ten liters of water. Drawn out, these were seen to be of gelatinous substance, which quickly dried and disappeared, leaving a dark globule one millimeter in diameter, which, in the microscope, presented a transparent ovoid animulcule, filled with eggs, and moving its fins and tentacles incessantly. A drop of water added to the dark globule brought back its luminosity; and when the creature was bruised in hte hand, it gave a bright mark, which was quickly extinguished, and which had no smell. The milky water, kept till day and looked at in the dark, shows no luminosity, even though agitated; nor does the water procured by day and brought into darkness. It remains to be determined what causes the luminosity of those animalcula and information is also desirable as to the position of the various milky seas on the globe, the times of their appearance, whether they persist in the same place or not, etc. Several of the officers on board the Armide had witnessed the phenomenon before, but never so brilliant or so continuous. The Armide, in going out, had passed thirty leagues further north in February, 1878, without encountering anything of the kind.

Sumatray (Captain Briscoe), and on February 1, the vessel being then in N. lat 14 deg and E. long 53 deg (not far from the position described by your correspondent) had an opportunity of witnessing the phenomenon known as the "Milky Sea," rarely seen except in these waters. The following extract from by book, "An Engineer's Holiday," describing and explaining the appearance, may interest Mr. Barrett:- "The whole ocean, from the ship to the visible horizon, looked as if it were covered with snow, whose surface vidently shone by the reflected light of the sky, for Venus, being very bright, threw a distinguishable line of radiance across it, while the phosphorescent crests of waves were now and then seen breaking above the layer of shining matter which overlaid the water.""A current, always encountered north of Socotra, set the ship, on the day in question, fourteen miles to the northward of her course. This stream was crowded with large medusae, visible not only during the day, but also at night, whem being themselves non luminous, they appeared as whirling black discs in the general phosphorescence of the ship's wake. The ship's officers fully believed that this current brings with it, besides jelly fish, enormous quantities of decayed and phosphorescent matter to whose presence they attributed the appearance of the 'Milky Sea.' "The fact however, that the seeming snow reflects light, and is broken through by quite small waves, disposed of this explanation, and we soon convinced ourselves that the phenomenon is really due to a thin layer of mist lying on the water, exactly resembling one of those local fogs which every one has seen, and which may give to avalley or even a slight depression the appearance of being snowed up. It occurs when the sea is colder than the atmosphere, and the latter still and heavily loaded with aqueous vapour. Under these circumstances, a layer of air immediately in contact with the water is chilled below the dew point and becomes mistuy, while that above remains transparent: the upper surface of such a fog, which is only a few inches thick, being seen by the reflected light of the sky" ("An Engineer's Holiday," vol. ii. p. 314). The temperature of the sea on the night in question was 70 deg F., while that of the air was 79 deg, an unusual amount of difference in the Arabian Sea. Water, brought on deck by a bucket, showed no signs of milkiness, though crowded as ususal with various phosphorescent organisms. Dan Pidgeon. The Long House, Letherhead, September 24.

08/12/1882	21:00 LOC	08/13/1882	00:30 LOC	12 deg 45' N	53 deg 50' E	Diodem	Jackson, Captain	whilst steaming along the north coast of the island of Socotra, about five miles from land, on the 12th August, 1882, at 9 p.m., the night being dark and hazy and no moon visible, noticed that the sky to the eastward suddenly brightened as by a rising moon, and that a thin luminous streak had made its appearance upon the horizon stretching north to south. This gradually widened as the ship steamed towards it, and about 9.30 the ship passed almost instantaneously from the usual sea water into what appeared a sea of milk. Captain Jackson describes at length the effect produced, and speaks of the water as being "luminous" as well as "milky." The vessel was completely surrounded by the luminous water, which made the sky appear of inky blackness above, and gave the sea, which was really at the time moderately rough, the appearance of a dead calm. The ship appeared to be stopped. Small pieces of seaweed floating past stood out dark and clearly defined in the water, and could be distinctly seen and distinguished some sixty yards away. That lasted until about 12.30 a.m., when the ship passed out of it again almost as suddenly as she had entered it, and the sea and the sky were as before. At 10.30, and when the sea was at its brightest, three bucketsful of water were drawn from over the side, and then carefully strained through a milk handkerchief, the luminous residue being carefully lifted out with a tablespoon and put into a bottle with about three glasses of whiskey. That was the bottle sent to me by Mr. Moore. Captain Jackson further notes that the luminosity was not confined to the surface, since the water brought up by the deck-pump, the suction-pipe of which entered the sea at a depth of about twenty feet, was exactly the same as that drawn in the buckets, "except that the luminous bodies were all broken up in their passage through the pump."

India to London I had an opportunity (owing to the kindness of Captain Worcester) of witnessing what seems to be a rare phenomenon. The commander had seen it two or three times in the course of his experience. No one else on board knew anything about it, and I should be glad of a reference to any detailed description. At 1.30 a.m. on the morning of August 22, in the Indian Ocean, the officer in charge saw ahead what seemed to be a low mist, and into which the vessel steamed. I was called about fifteen minutes later. The whole sea was milk-white, much more luminous than the clear, starry sky, and there was a very definite horizon. There was no moon, the wind was south-west and light-the end of the monsoon; and although the sea was, as a matter of fact, breaking here and there, it appeared a calm white sheet only disturbed by the displacement waves near the ship and a very occasional breaker elsehwere; showing through it were occasional flashed of the ordinary brilliant phosphorescence. It will therefore be seen that the luminosity of the "white sea" was rather less than that of a breaking wave with the same illumination. A bucket of water drawn showed nothing unusual. Samples with and without alcohol were preserved. A fireball was thrown overboard, and burnt on the surface of the water; this was done ot see if any fog or mist was present. There was no indication of anything of the kind. On the port side of the ship is an aperture through which the surplus water from the bath tanks if constantly ejected, slightly warmed. This water, as it fell on to the sea, appeared much blacker than the sea, and floated for a few seconds as a black mass; unfortunately, the same shoot is used for the ashes at times. But the ejected water is quite white by daylight. The appearance of the sea lasted about an hour, then faded, then brightened again, and was quite bright at daylight, 4.15 a.m.; so that it was seen throughout a distance of nearly fifty miles. A slight recurrence was observed the following night, when the monsoon was blowing more strongly. At 3 o'clock on the 22nd, in the midst of the "white sea," the latitude was 10 deg 35'N. and the longitude 63 deg 25' E; the temperature of the air was 77 deg F., that of the water 77 deg F. Specific gravity of the water by ship's instrument No. 1314 = 25. I shall be glad to hand over the specimens of water to any one interested. James W. Barrett. 22 Cavendish Square, September 13.

The whole surface of the water was brilliantly lit up, giving the sea a milky white appearance. The horizon around was exceptionally clear cut, and the whiteness of the sea gave the sky an inky black appearance, although the sky was quite clear and cloudless and the stars were shining brightly.

The night was bright and starlight, and previous to encountering this there was a strong monsoon wind (S.S.W.) blowing and a rough sea running. On entering this field of whiteness the sea seemed to moderate considerably, although the vessel's speed did not seem to be reduced. The sea became normal again at 11 p.m., the ship then being in Latitude 12 deg 33' N., Longitude 56 deg 49' E. and the previous monsoon weather continued until Sokotra was reached.	Mar.

The sea was so white that one was not able to distinguish the ship's wake nor the wash of the water against the ship's side. During this time (9.20 p.m. till 10.40 p.m.) the atmospheric conditions were extraordinary, no sound was heard, not even the wind nor the breaking of the sea, no swell was visible, and the vessel, which had previously been rolling heavily, had practically no movement on her: in fact, one could almost have imagined the vessel was in dock. During the time the vessel was in this white water there appeared to be at an altitude from the hoirzon of about 10' pitch black clouds, wheras there were no clouds at all. At 10.15 p.m. a sample of sea water was taken, Temp. 75 deg, Specific Gravity 25, and contained quantities of phospheric particles in various shapes, some of the threads ranging from 1/4 inch to 1 inch long. At 10.30 p.m. the sea to the westward gradually became normal again, but that to the eastward was still white. At 11.00 p.m. the whole of the sea became normal, the whiteness just disappearing very gradually. On August 14th, 8.30 p.m. (1643 G.M.T.), in Latitude 11 deg 40' N., Longitude 59 deg 23' E. Luminous water was again seen. Particulars much the same, except that on this occasion the whiteness of the water, which was even brighter than the night before, only lasted 20 minutes and disappeared suddenly. As the vessel came out of the white water into normal coloured water, one could see a very distinct line between the two, and on looking astern, it had the appearance of a vessel coming out of a dense fog.

"Karimata", gezagvoerder de heer J. A. Brouwer, bijgehouden door den 4den officier J. van Essen, wordt het volgende ontleend: Eenige malen werd zeer graai een z.g. melkzee waargenomen; hieronder wolgen eenige bijzonderheden daaromtent. Na het passeeren van Ras Radressa-Sokotra nam de harde Z.W. moesson geleidlijk af, evenals zee en deining. Op de P.V. d.d. 17  Aug. 1925 te 7.05 werd plotseling helderwiite waterdamp waargenomen, die zeer snel hoogen en hooger kwam. Te 7.15 werd het minder geworden zicht weder beter. De zee werd sterk lichtgevend en daarna melkachtig van kleur. De temperatuur van het zeewater daalde van 27 gr tot 24.2 gr, terwijl die der buitenlucht 25 gr was. De verdere wacht bleef het zeer fraaie verschijnsel aanhouden, doch de zeewatertemperatuur steed inmiddels weder tot 27 gr. Het zicht was zeer goed; speciaal de scheiding tusschen water en de bijzonder heldere lucht aan S.B. was uiterst scherp; als een zwarte streep teekende de lucht zich tegen het als matglas uitziende water af. Aan B.B. was het zicht iets minder. Het helderwitte schijnsel begon op de E.W. iets af te nemen, terwijl te 8.30 aan de zuidelijke kim een streep gewoon donker water te zien was, die langzaam doorzette en verdween. Te 8.35 kwam recht vooruit en aan weerszijden vooruit weden een zwarte streep water in het zicht, die steeds breeder werd, terwijl te 8.42 de tamelijk scherpe afscheiding tusschen lichtgevend en gewoon water werd gepasseerd; de richting van deze grenslijn was van N.N. O. tot Z.Z.W., van kim tot kim. Het water bleef daarna af en toe sterk vurende. Den volgenden dag op de P.V. was het water weder sterk vurend en op de E.W. stoomden we weder door een melkachtig gekleurde zee, waarvan de temperatuur 26 gr was. Van 8.25-9.00 nam het verschijnsel geleidelijk af en toe, om vervolvgens te verdwijnen; het opvallende nu was, dat slechts het zeewater aan lij sterk vuurde, welk verschijnsel vele malen werd waargenomen. Aan het einde der wacht herhaalde de melkachtige kleur zich weden en op de H.W. werd daarna het navolgende waargenomen. Fraai weer. Licht W.Z.W. koelte. Zeer heldere lucht. Licht Z.W. deining. Temperatuur buitenlucht 26.2 gr. Die van hee zeewater 25.5 gr. Water rondom van kim tot kim melkachtige kleur. Bijzonder scherpe scheiding tusschen water en lucht. Zicht zeer goed (zulks was te beoordeelen aan eenige schepen die in het zicht kwamen). Ten I uur minder wordende kim en afnemende kleur. Het plaatselijk vurende water sterker. Ten 1.15 was alles verdwenen. Ten 3 uur passeerden we wederom een witachtige zee. Langs de zuidelijke kim vertoonde zich een donkere strook water, terwijl langs de noordelijke kim een zilverwitte streep te zien was. Verdere kleur van het water als van matglas. De temperatuur bleek 25.2 gr te zijn. Daarna langzaam verzwakkende kleur met toename van plaatselijk sterk phosphoriseerende plekken.Opgeslagen water bevatte allerei naaldvormige lichtgevende bestanddeelen, ongeveer één cm. lang. Op de D.W. kreeg het water weden een donkere tint; nadien werd het bovengenoemde verschijnsel niet meer waargenomen, doch wel zeer sterk vurend water, echter uitsluitend aan B.B. (lijkant).

The sea became luminous from horizon to horizon each evening between 8.30 p.m. and 9.00 p.m., and disappeared in the morning about an hour before daylight. It gave an effect of the ship sailing in a sea of milk, and at times was very bright, and it was possible to read Azimuth Tables on the bridge by the light, usually between the hours of 2 a.m. to 4 a.m. The horizon sharp and distinct except for a point each side of magnetic north.

The weather being gloomy, with steady wind and rain, just ahead appeared a luminous streak of water closely resembling a submerged reef. It proved to be phosphorescence and, as nearly as could be judged, of only 2 cables extent. As the ship passed through the patch, the water was noted to be of milky appearance, and waves of luminous air seemed to rise above the sea almost to the height of the main deck. Almost immediately the ship passed clear and no further indications were observed elsewhere.	Mar. Obs. 1926, 08, Vol III, no 32	South China Sea	(?)	0	N/A	52

The weather during the day was normal, wind S.E., force 4. Swell S.S.E. 3. Barometer stready around 1025.7 mb., mean temperature of air 62 deg F, water 58 deg F., sky cloudless and exceptionally clear. At 6.30 p.m., beaing abeam of Mostardos Lighthouse, in Latitude 31 deg 20' S, Longitude 50 deg 45' W., light wisps of Cirrus were observed in the zenith moving from W. by S. These, however showed no signs of increasing, but apparently disappeared with coming of dark. At the same time a heavy bank of Cu-Nb and Nb was seen to be banking up from W.S.W. accompanied by vivid fork and sheet lightning. By 8.00 p.m., the sky was completely overcast with heavy Cu-Nb, heavy drops of rain began to fall but ceased after a few minutes. The barometer remained steady at 1025.7 mbs., temperature of air 59 deg. Winds, variable, force 0-3. This prevailed until 10.00 p.m. when the sea became absolutely white with phosphorescence so that the vessel seemed to be moving in a sea of milk, at the same time a curious phenomenon was observed, the sky which was composed of very heavy Cu-Nb appeared to break up and turn absolutely white, looking like white Cumulus clouds in the sunlight and had the general appearance of a gigantic honeycomb extending over the whole vault of the heavens. No stars were visible. At 11.00 p.m., the phosphorescence susbsided to isolated patches on breaking waves. Co-incident with its subsidence the sky again became pitch black, vivid lightning now played across the heavens from all directions, thunder being heard in the S.W. At midnight the conditions were the same, the barometer steady at 1026.1 mb., air 50 deg, wind N.E., force 0-3, swell S.S.E. 3. Between midnight and 1.00 a.m. a few drops of heavy rain fell and the barometer fell 3.4 mb., in hte hour (1026.1 mb. to 1022.7 mb.). At 1.30 a.m. the sea again became milky white with phosphorescence, so as the render the shore lights invisible, and the same phenomenon was observed in the sky although not in such a marked degree as previously, rather the sky had a curious dappled white appearance and seemed to be composed of all sorts of erratic shapes, diamonds, circles, &c.; this lasted for fifteen minutes, the sea again losing its phosphorescence appearance, the sky becoming black at the same time. A small break now appeared to the westward through which stars were visible, this however disappeared in a few minutes, the heavy thunder clouds rolling up as black if not blacker than before. The lightning flashes became incessant, roll after roll of thunder pealing, but very little, if any, rain. During this period we arrived off the port and anchored at 2.00 a.m. The barometer now commenced to rise slowly, the storm appeared to die away to isolated flashes and peals. At 4.00 a.m. heavy rain set in, a steady downpour; the wind remaining at N.E., force 3, the barometer continued rising until 5.00 a.m. when it commenced to fall again. The wind now shifted to N.N.E., freshening, force 6-7. Heavy rain still falling. This type of weather prevailed until 7.30 a.m., the rain then ceased and the sky clearing slightly; there was however no change in the wind, the thunder clouds having also passed on. It is almost impossible to describe the awe-inspiring grandeur of that sky, it seemed to hint at the supernatural, this I know sounds ridiculous, but any others who witnessed it will, I am sure, agree with me. Other outstanding points are the absence of rain and wind until after the passing of the electric storm.	Mar. Obs., 1927, 10, Vol IV, no 46	Brazil	Milky Sea	0	N/A	56

(1033 M.T.G.) in Latitude 4 deg 53' S., Longitude 129 deg 17' E., with approaching darkness the sea was observed to be luminous and when the sky was completely dark the effect was very extraordinary. It did not appear to be caused by surface phosphorescence as the bow waves did not give the usual sparkle as when steaming through phosphorescence, but were quite dead. The intensity appeared to process from large quantities of phosphorescence deep down in the water, causing a diffused light to brighten up the whole sea. This phenomenon continued with varying degrees of intensity throughout the night and at daybreak the following morning the sea was its usual deep blue black. At noon, Augus 14th (0333 M.T.G.), the density of the sea was 1,022 1/2, temperature 80 deg at 1900 A.T.S., desnity 1,023 1/2, temperature 76 deg, at midnight 1,024, and temperature 78 deg at 0400 A.T.S. 15th density 1,023, temperature 77 deg.

The sea became the colour of milk and was slightly luminous and whereas previously the sky had been lighter in appearance than the sea, the reverse now took place. A rough sea was running at the time and the wave tops had been quite conspicuous, but on meeting this discoloured water the sea appeared to calm down and no water came on board during the time the ship was passing through. Its western limit was quite well defined, more so than the eastern edge, and the former was visible quite fifteen or twenty minutes before the ship arrived there.

Brown, Third Officer	Whilst reading the August, 1929, number of The Marine Observer I saw the reports of unusual phosphorescence in the Arabian Sea, and as we experienced a similar occurrence in corresponding month fairly near the same locality, I thought you might be interested to know of it. On Friday, 2nd August, 1929, in the Gulf of Aden, Latitude 12 deg 49' N., Longitude 50 deg 26' E., course 264 deg, 11 knots. At 9.30 p.m. A.T.S. the ship appeared to be approaching a bank of mist and at 9.45 p.m. ran into 'White Water'. In a short time the sea from horizon to horizon appeared as one expanse of snow. It has been described as the colour of milk, which is an excellent description, but should not be confused with what is usually termed 'Milky' for this was a pure white. The sea immediately moderated. The usual sparkling effect was totally absent, the phosphorescence evidently being at a considerable depth. This was a most extraordinary sight and lasted until 11.45 p.m., when we ran out of the 'White Water' into that of a normal colour.	Mar. Obs. 1930, 08, Vol VII, no 80	Arabian Sea	Milky Sea	0	N/A	66

At 1808 hours observed sea impregnated with phosphorescence. At 1818 hours ship encountered phosphorescenct sea, and in a few minutes the whole sea all round, to the limits of visibility, was phosphorescent, giving a peculiar effect, somewhat like a moderated moonlight night, with a calm sea in shallow water. Breaking waves showed up as temporary dark patches. There was a very definite line of demarcation where the phosphorescence began, and it appeared to be travelling in a N.E'ly direction. At 1938 hours the phosphorescence began to ease off-by 2008 hours it was much less, and by 2038 hours on the moon rising it was no longer discernible to the naked eye. From 1853 to 1923 we passed some hundreds of what appeared to be dead snakes, motionless, many passing very close to the ship's side, being plainly visible in the light thrown from the ship's decks and showing up black in the phosphorescence. Some were more or less straight, others in sinuous forms and apparently tangled. On a wave breaking over them, there was no sign of movement or life.

Gepp, Third Officer	In view of various reports, which have from time to time been published in The Marine Observer, concerning "White Water" in and near the Gulf of Adean, it is interesting to note that exactly the same conditions and appearance were observed on the night of the 20th August, 1930, from S.S. Atreus. The milky appearance of the sea was first observed at 7.30 p.m. (A.T.S.), one hour and twenty minutes after sunset, in Latitude 12 deg 38' N., Longitude 55 deg 19' E., ship then steering 105 deg at 13 knots. The general appearance of the sea was a whitish, milky liquid, entirely lacking in the bright sparkle usually associated with phosphorescence, and giving to an observer the impression of sources of light at some considerable depth below the surface. Although the sky was practically cloudless, and the visibility good, as observed by the lights of another vessel proceeding in the same direction some miles distant, it appeared as though there was a thick haze or mist over the sea, which at times rendered the horizon totally indiscernible. Until 11.30 p.m. (A.T.S.) this "white water" was enocuntered in large patches, some stretching as far as the eye could see, the patches being interspersed with small darking patches and irregularly shaped belts of normal sea water. Over these latter patches there was no apeparance as of haze or mist, though this was readily discernible above the "milky" patches. After 1.20 a.m. (A.T.S.) in Latitude 12 deg 20' N., Longitude 56 deg 27' E., the ship apparently ran out of the "white water," as no more "milky" patches were to be seen. Upon first entering the above area, the wind, sea, and swell, which had been heavy from the S.W., began to moderate. Temperature off air was 79.3 def F and sea 78.0 deg F during this period.	Mar.

Hassell, Second Officer	On August 28th, 1930, at about 11 p.m. A.T.S., north of Socotra, the vessel ran suddenly into a line of milky luminescence stretching from horizon to horizon in a north and south line, in about Latitude 13 deg 14' N., Longitude 52 deg 57' E. This appearance gave a perfectly radiant glow, making the heavens appear an inky black. All the stars were showing, and the sea after steaming for about an hour in an easterly direction had the appearance of a field of snow, being illuminated from underneath, in fact the phenomenon was almost indescribable. Several samples of the water were taken in a bucket, and when examined in the dark seemed to contain thousands of very thin lines of light, some apparently about half an inch in length, others much shorter, but when the water was examined in the light in the chartroom, very little could be seen. A bottle of this water has been retained. There was absolutely no sparkle in the water as in ordinary luminescence, and the waves broke seemingly of a black colour. The discharge from the condenser also appeared black. The sea was rough. Just before steaming out of this patch, the appearance seemed to increase in brilliancy, and I can only describe the effect as a vessel steaming through a field of pure white, illuminated show. We steamed out of this at 2.50 a.m. A.T.S. as suddenly as we entered it, in Latitude 13 deg 47' N., Longitude 53 deg 32' E., and after getting into normal water a brilliant glow was visible from north to south astern the ship.

The water, however appeared to be smooth, because each combing breaker left a shadowless wake of white, boiling water. "The expanse of water had every semblance of a sea of milk," he reported. The phenomenon continued for five hours, throwing the horizon of ink-black sky and milky sea into bold contrast.	The New York Times, Nov. 1, 1931	North Atlantic	Milky Sea	0	N/A	69

The night was very dark, although the sky was cloudless and the stars brilliant. The phenomenon covering the whole of the sea all round the horizon to the limits of visibility, gave the effect of the sea being illuminated by some unseen light underneath which was both peculiar and beautiful. There was no premature disturbance or warning of any description the vessel running suddenly into a mass of pale, but intense green sea with silvery-white edges to the waves, somewhat similar in appearance to the illuminated dial of a wrist-watch, and on a much larger scale. The waves, breaking in the distance, gave the appearance of the sails of a small yacht having a beam of light played upon them (as from a powerful electric torch). As each bow wave broke, the white paintwork of the bridge and vessel's superstructure was brilliantly illuminated, and as the wave settled abaft the beam the contrast between the phosphorescence and the darker or non-phosphorescent water was most marked. Scattered throughout the sea, in proximity to the vessel, were numerours small balls of phosphorous, giving an illumination of greater intensity. After about two hours the vessel passed out of this phosphorescent area as quickly as she entered it. Phosphorescent observed between Latitude 16 deg 56' S., Longitude 3 deg 55' E. and Latitude 17 deg 16' S., Longitude 4 deg 11' E. Ship's course 143 deg, speed 12 1/2 knots.	Mar.

Drake, Third Officer	December 29th, 1931, at 8.15 p.m. A.T.S., the ship entered, or was suddenly surrounded by an area of white water. It seemed as though shoal water stretched from horizon to horizon, being of a pale milky appearance, making the sky, already dark with Strato-Cumulus and Fracto-Nimbus clouds, look inky black. The most noticeable feature of the phenomenon was that, although there was a fresh northerly breeze blowing, the previously rough sea and moderate short swell were appreciably diminished. In point of fact, where there had been breaking seas all over, there were during the hour the white water was visible, very few crests on the sea, as if this luminescence was of an oleaginous quality. Floating objects appeared jet black and two dimensional. A faint haze of light seemed to be cast upward from some depth, causing a strain to the eye. At 1745 G.M.T. the phenomenon faded, and where the sky had seemed black and the sea almost white the sea now became black and the sky lighter. An examination of a sample of surface water with a low power lens (sextant reader) failed to reveal any specimens of plankton or other marine life from which it was judged that the light came from some depth, an hypothesis apparently supported by its eerie diffused quality. No difference was noted, either in temperature or in density between the white and the surrounding water. Sea temperature 76 deg, density 1026.2.

Armstrong, Third Officer	September 5th 1932 at 2 a.m. the ship entered an area of phosphorescence of an uncommon type. Our position at that time was about sixty miles north of Cape Guardafui, the weather being fine, overcast and hazy with a wind S.S.E. 3 veering and freshening as we approached the Monsoon and we were on the fringe of the current which sets north between Abd-al-Kuri and the mainland. The phosphorescence was of a sub-surface character and seemed to be at some considerable depth; there were no sparkles or patches of brightness in the bow wave or in the wash along the ship's side. The effect of the phenomenon was that of diffused illumination at the bottom of the ocean giving a steady continuous light showing from horizon to horizon. A moderate S.E. swell was running with a rising sea. At 3 a.m. the horizon was indistinguishable and at 4 a.m. the water was brighter than the sky. At the approach of daylight the phosphorescence waned and the water was its normal colour until the evening. At 9 p.m. the illumination reappeared in the same form increasing in intensity until it showed from horizon to horizon and it remained visible on the second night until daylight on the 6th when we appeared to pass out of it altogether. No phosphorescence was seen on the following evening. A remarkable feature about the whole phenomenon was the difficulty experienced in gauging the visibility; particularly was this so on the evening of the 5th. At 11 p.m. the lights of a passing steamer were observed at a distance of seven miles when actually the visibility seemed to be less than two.

Na een betrekklijk koelan dag (gemiddelde dagtemperatuur 25 gradens C), waarbij een matige moesson doorstond, werd bij een frissche tot matige ZZW koelte, bij een watertemperatuur van gemiddeld 23 gradens C., de volgende verschijnselen waargenomen, gepaard gaande met zwaren daue en een sterke koraallucht. Stuurden N.106 gradens O. r.w. bij een vaart van ongeveer 12 3/4 mijl per uur. Te 19.00 op 12 gr 45' N.b. en 57 gr 09' O.l., liep het schip in een onafzienbare melkzee. Na een poosje in het donker op de brug te hebben gestaan, maakte het den indruk van een zich tot den horizon uitstrekkend ijsveld; waarboven de totaal onbewolkte hemel en melkweg bijzonder scherp afstaken. Het geheel maakte een imposanten indruk. Te 20.50 op 12 gr 38' N.b en 57 gr 34' O.l. was de melkzee gepasseerd. Er was geen directe overgang, geleidelijk nam de lichte kleur van het water af. Toen de melkzee uit het aicht was, werd de lucht boven de Zuidelijke en Westelijke kim hierdoor nog merkbaar verlicht. Te 22.20 op 12 gr 34' N.b. en 57 gr 54' O.l. werd opnieuw in een dergelijke melkzee gestoomd. thans was de kim minder duidelijk zichtbaar, hoewel het zicht goed leek. Te 23.40 op 12 gr 27' N.b. en 58 gr 10' O.l. was ook deze gepasseerd, doch bleef het water licht van kleur.

Van 3.00 tot 3.30 was de kleur van het water normaal. Na 3.30 tot 4.45 steeds melkkleurig water in verschillende kleurschakeeringen, waarna het verschijnsel geleidlijk afnam. Zooals bekend, wordt de melkkleurige zee veroorzaakt door microscopisch kleine lichtende organismen. 	Tim Wyatt, Unpublished Notes/Paper	Arabian Sea	Milky Sea	0	N/A	74

Vessel at the time was steering 069 degrees at 14.0 knots bount Torres Strait, weather was very fine and clear, with light easterly breeze, slight sea and no swell. Temperature of the air 79 deg, sea 80 deg, no moon, but stars very clear and visible almost to the horizon. Phenomenon was first observed at midnight August 27th by a lightening in the sky to the eastward (a reflection from the sea on alto-cumulus cloud); this rapidly extended over the whole sky, the vessel entering dull luminous water at 00.30 A.T.S. August 28th in Latitude 9 deg 33' S., Longitude 127 deg 56' E. By 01.00 A.T.S. the sky was inky black, no clouds and stars showing very bright; the sea in all directions was a bright consistent milky-white colour showing up the horizon clearly and lighting up the ship and atmosphere to the brilliancy of a full moon. Speed was reduced and soundings taken as it appeared that the vessel might be in very shallow water, but no bottom was obtained at 120 fathoms. The water during this period did not appear to be lit by phosphorescence but as if by some powerful light at a considerable depth, the water having a strange transparent look and the bow wave showing dark in comparison to the water below, the whole effect being most extraordinary. These conditions continued with little change till 02.40 A.T.S. in Latitude 9 deg 24' S., Longitude 128 deg 31' E., when the sea became normal, the luminous bank passing to the westward showing up the western horizon and sky clearly as if lit by a full moon until 03.00 A.T.S.

At 2012 the ship entered a large area of a dull phosphorescent-like glow which as ship progressed, entirely surrounded her, by 2020 the "glow" being of about the same intensity as the luminous dial of a watch. The wash created and the rush of water down the ship's side showed no outstanding phosphorescent brillance as is frequently noticeable, and the track left by several porpoises which were around the ship for a few minutes showed only the very least brighter. Only a very occasional bright patch was seen, the whole being of the same intensity and maintaining a uniform dull phosphorescent glow. The greatest brilliance occurred at 2030, after which and until 2133 it varied slightly and at which time the ship passed out of the area, though the glow was to be seen astern for a further 12 minutes. A ship two points on our port bow bound the same way -- distant about 4 miles -- proved difficult to see when she entered the luminous area, her lights being considerable "dimmed" by the brightness of the water. In a W. by S. to E. by N. direction this phenomenon extended an uninterrupted distance of 23 miles. During the time the phosphorescence continued, the horizon was not definable, but in its place the ship seemed to be enclosed by a "black wall" having a depth of about 3 deg. Above this the sky and low stars were easily discernible. Position of ship, Latitude 17 deg 01' N, Longitude 63 deg 42' E., Course 257 deg, speed 16 3/4 knots. Night of February 12th-13th. At frequent intervals during the night the ship passed through areas of an intense phosphorescent brilliance unlike the effect of last night, when the whole sea was of one colour, the sea in this case appeared like the sky on a clear cloudless night, the stars being represented (though magnified many times) by the phosphorescent patches which though mainly of small size, at times extended over area many yards square. These patches could be seen some distance and had a flashing appearance which at times looked like the lights of a ship so much that the lookouts reported them as such, and it was also noticeable from the bridge. When the was created by the ship broke, the brilliance was intense, lighting up the ship's side, and being almost of a turquoise blue colour. Approximate positio of ship at midnight, Latitude 15 deg N., Longitude 55 deg E., Course 256 deg, speed 16 3/4 knots. Night of February 13th-14th. A similar phenomenon to last night occurred again to-night but if anything the brilliance was greater and more spectacular, especially in the colour of the water disturbed by the ship's bow wave. The reflection from this could be noted on the deck head of the navigation bridge (height 70 ft. above sea level). Approximate position of ship at midnight, Latitude 13 deg N. Longitude 48 deg E.

Weather, strong S.S.W. wind, rough sea, heavy short S.S.W. swell, sky one-third clouded, A.-St., Ci. and Ci.-St. Vessel entered large patches of phosphorescent water. By 7.05 p.m. (Ship's Time) the sea had turned to milky white of intense luminosity. The impression given to the observer was that the vessel was in a snow-covered plain and also that the vessel was in shoal water. The position of the vessel confirmed that was was well over 100 fms. soundings. This milky white appearance of sea extended right around the horizon and the luminosity was so intense that the state of the sea and swell was entirely lost to visual observation. At 7.40 p.m. (Ship's Time) this phenomenon began to disappear gradually and by 7.50 p.m. the condition of the surrounding water became normal. Temperature air 77 deg F. Surface temperature of water 78 deg F. Position of ship, Latitude 12 deg 48' N., Longitude 57 deg 30' E., course 100 deg, speed 12 1/2 knots.

Temperature air 76 deg F. Temperature of surface water 78 def F. At 1.00 a.m. the moon came up bearing E.N.E. and the milky white appearance of the sea commenced to disappear to the S.W. and by 1.20 a.m. the phenomenon cleared away.

Branch, Third Officer	April 8th 1935 10 to 12 p.m. A.T.S. passed through very extensive and brilliant phosphorescent waters. At first it was noticeable only as the waves broke, but later, large and very intense patches of milky fluid were encountered. As mention in the Marine Observer's Handbook these patches did definitely assert a calming effect upon the sea surface. They could be compared to the effect that would be produced by light oils on the water. It was difficult to estimate the exact size of these patches but they were roughly circular in shape and of about 2 miles in diameter. Between them the water showed only normal phosphorescence. Some of this "milky fluid" caught in a bucket revealed nothing abnormal and it is possible the source of this light may be some distance beneath the surface. The horizon appeared to vanish altogether, being replaced by a broad band of pale light reaching, approximately, 10 deg up from the true horizon. An important feature was the fact that all sense of judging visibility and distances was destroyed. Air temperature 79 deg F. Sea temperature at frequent intervals 81 deg F.

The horizon could not be distinguished, the gleaming of sky and water was alike. It seemed that the ship was surrounded by a thick fog, but there was no mist arond the lamps of the ship. Cloudiness was insignificant, but soon it became continuous. A burning buoy, thrown on the water for the purpose of determining visibiity, disappeared in 20 minutes; this indicated a visibility of seven miles. The wave crests were white. Fish not only did not emit and luminescense, they appeared black. At 2345 it was still impossible to discern the white milky colour at a distance of 1-2 miles, which suggested shallows, the the actual depth ranged from 2400 to 2700 meters. At midnight the water appeared normal and the horizon was visible again. Water temperature 77 deg F; swell considerable; speed 12 kt.; wind velocity 1-3. Posn: 16 deg N, 54 deg E.	E.W.

Taylor, Second Officer	28th to 29th August, 1946, 2040 to 0150 G.M.T. it was very dark with sky cloudy to overcast. The horizon from NW through W to South became illuminated as if from the looms of numerous powerful shore lights. After a few minutes a white line appeared on the horizon and spread rapidly until the white water surrounded the ship. The sea was a light grey with considerable luminosity, although not phosphorescent, similar to its appearance during full moon, although the moon, only 3 days old, had already sea. The sea also appeared quite calm and no "white horses" visible, but this was obviously not the true state of affairs as the motion of the vessel and relative wind force was the same as previously, when in a moderate SW'ly swell, light sea, and wind SW force 4-5. The cloud formation disappeared during the first half-hour but made no difference to the appearance of the sea. The first occurrences were observed from 2150 to 2215 G.M.T. and lastly from 2235 G.M.T. on the 28th to 0150 G.M.T. on the 29th. The last two occurrences, however, were not so bright as the first. During the last occurrence there appeared to be a complete formation of altostratus or cirrostratus veiling the whole sky and no stars were visible. Estimation of cloud height was not possible. During the phenomenon the horizon was well-defined, except to the SE, being especially so to the N and NE, where the line of white sea and black cloud showed up well. Estimation of visibility was impossible throughout and could have been anything between 2 and 2 miles.

At 0400 sea normal, sky completely covered with stratocumulus at 5,000 ft. approximately. Wind fresh from SW, moderate sea and long heavy SW'ly swell. At 0430 observed a whiteness ahead which at first appeared as a low-lying fog bank. On nearer approach it was seen that the sea itself was quite white and looked like breakers. Soundings were taken but no bottom found at 130 fathoms. Demarcation between normal and white sea was very plain, running NW to SE. Sea temperature before entering this area of whiteness was 76 deg F. At 0450 vessel entered this area, which stretched from horizon to horizon on both sides, and at 0505 the whole visible ocean was white with more of a diffused light than normal phosphorescence. The crests of waves were visible by their blackness against this uniformly lit sea. Two fish showed up as black and left no trail behind as they swam away. Sea temperature was now 77 deg. At 0515 vessel commenced to run out of this area, the line of separation was less pronounced on the SW side. Sea temperature started to fall and by 0700 was 71 deg and remained steady.

The sea ahead was observed to be gradually changing to a dull phosphorescent glow. At 2015 A.T.S. the glow was similar in intensity to the luminous dial on a watch, and it streatched N and S as far as the eye could see. At 2100 the sea reached its greatest brilliance, making the horizon appear black compared with the water. Above an angle of 10 deg the stars were easily seen. At 2200 the glow on the sea gave the appearance of shoal water and there was no brilliant phosphorescence sparkle usually seen from the wash of the vessel.

All around as far as could be seen the was was all white appearing like a snow or ice field, giving off an intense white light or glow. This white cover seemed to be about 2 feet deep. Before the discoloured water was entered the atch officer could easily see its edges which were sharply defined. This discolored water remained visible all night, until 0500 ship's time (gradually diminishing after 0400), on August 25, 1949, in approximately lat. 11 deg 57' N., lon 51 deg 28' E., and was observed by both officers and crew. No one on board had ever seen anything like it before. A sample of water taken and in the bucket small thin white threads, 1 inch long and smalled, could be seen distinctly, but as soon as the light was put on they became invisible. Ordinary phosphorescence was also observed which was altogether different from the white threads which gave off a continuous white light or glow. On the surface a great many black round spots or stains about 4 to 6 inches in diameter were observed. When viewed from the ship's bow it was just like ploughing through an ice or snow field about 2 feet thick. The night was clear (without the moon); wind SW., force 5-4; sea SW., amount 4-3; temperature of air, 74 deg F.; barometer, 29.82 inches.

T. in lat. 17 deg 12' N., lon. 56 deg 40' E., the southwestern horizon commenced to whiten. Ten minutes later the surface of the sea about the vessel assumed a milky color which reduced the visibility to 5 miles. This discoloration was considerably different from that of phosphorescence. During the phenomenon which lasted 4 1/2 hours the lower layers of the atmosphere acquired a very thin whitish appearance reaching to approximately 15 deg of altitude dimming the brilliancy of the stars. Although the sea was rough and the vessel pitched and rolled, taking moderately heavy seas over the forecastle it seemed as though the sea was calm and almost glassy as neither waves nor crests could be observed, except the bow wave which was dark in color. At about 0015 G. C. T., August 9, the sky to the south took on a lighter appearance than the sea below it, and the contrary occurred in the north. At 0050 G. C. T. in lat. 16 deg 48' N., lon 55 deg 30' E. the ocean to the south-west began to darken and eight minutes later the surface of the sea had returned to its usual color and waves and crests again appeared.

Unusual phosphorescence was observed during the night and early morning while proceeding along the Arabian coast between Masira Island and Khabilya Island. The sea at the time was one sheet of glowing light, the colour of milk, reaching from horizon to horizon, giving the impression that we were proceeding across a huge flat field of snow. Although the sea was breaking heavily at the time the wave crests became invisible, and the phenomenon created the impression of a flat calm. Occasionally a wave crest would appear as a line of electric-blue fire. So marked was the difference between the sea and sky, which was lightly clouded at the time, that the horizon was clearly defined and it would have been a simple matter to have taken star observations. The phosphorescence lasted for several hours at a time.	Mar. Obs. 1951, 07, Vol XXI, no 153	Arabian Sea	Milky Sea	0	N/A	91

On August 14, 1950 ship's time in lat. 20 deg 00' N, lon 59 deg 00' E., the ship entered an area of discolored water which was milky white in appearance and lasted until about 0430 the following morning. The discoloration was first observed between Masirah Island and Ras Abu Rasas, and was last noted near Ras Madrakah. Upon entering the white water the sea temperature was observed to rise from 69 deg to 78 deg F., and when the vessel passed out of the phenomenon the water temperature dropped again. The sky was clear with a thick haze on the horizon; wind SSW. to SW.; force 4 to 5; rough SW'ly sea and swell; barometer 29.59 to 29.64 inches; air temperature 76 deg to 78 deg F. A second occurrence of the phenomenon was encountered during the evening of August 15 between the Kuria Muria Islands and the area off Jabal Jingjili in lat. 17 deg 00' N., lon. 56 deg 00' E. The milky water brightened the horizon considerably when it first showed up and from 1930 to 2230 the water was almost pure white. Immediately on entering the disclored water the sea temperature rose from 68 deg F. to 77 deg F. It is believed that because of the sudden rise in temperature that this discolored area was definitely i the form of a warm current from the south and was probably more heavily laden with microscopic plant and animal life than the ordinary sea water. Samples of the water were obtained and upon agitating it in a dark room it glowed very brightly. The sky was overcast; wind SW, force 5; rough sea; barometer 29.44 inches; air temperature 76 deg F. (H1/15-4).	E.W. Barlow's Records	Oman	Milky Sea	0	N/A	92

During the night watches the sea, from horizon to horizon, appeared to be illuminated from beneath. The effect was that of a snow-covered field, with the sky, although clear, showing dark against the water. The source of the illumination was evidently entirely on the surface, as dark patches showed through where the water was disturbed by the movement of the ship. The phenomenon was first noticed at 2200 G.M.T. on the 15th, persisting until daylight, and was observed again on the 16th from sunset to sunrise. Mid-position of ship: 11 deg 05' N, 62 deg 35'E.

The sea became much lighter in colour until it appeared to be milky. No wave crests or bow wwash could be distinguished from the surroundings although they had been well defined previously. This state existed for well over one hour. At times the horizon to the South darkened as thought the vessel was sailing at the edge of the phosphorescence. The milky appearance of the sea although diminishing in intensity existed for several hours. I realize that this phenomenon has been reported before from these parts, but the remarkable drop in sea temp has not been recorded and as can be seen is well below average for August and we hope that you will find this information useful.

Phosphorescence was observed in the form of broad streaks, about 50 ft. apart which stretched right across the horizon. It emitted a very bright glare which was first observed 8 to 10 miles away and resembled the lights of a large town showing on the horizon. On approaching, the streaks became clearly defined and looked exactly like waves breaking on a shore. On a course of 147 deg at 14.5 knots we continued through the phosphorescence for some 20 minutes; over this period the visibility was seriously affected, being reduced to 1-2 miles, and a strong, oily, fishy odour was present. As the phosphorescence passed astern the glare died away, finally disappeared a little over an hour after it was first observed. The wind was SE force 2, with negligible sea and swell.

At 2310, the vessel entered a patch of phosphorescence where the sea took on the appearance of milk with an oily surface. The Aldis Lamp was turned on to it in order to investigate the cause, but with no success. The beam of the lamp was surrounded by a glow as though in fog, rather like a bright lunar halo. The patch was cleare at 2340, and a similar one entered at 2345. This was brighter than the first; the horizon could not be seen and the lights of the ship seemed to be dimmed. Even the ship's bow wave lost its usual brightness. The patch was cleared at 0045 on the 31st, and nothing further was seen. Both patches extended as far as could be seen in all directions. The weather was fine and clear with 1/10 cloud and the wind was SW, force 4. [There is a note from E.W.

Bull. but not which one.] On March 19, 1952, from 8:30 to 10:00 p.m. we passed through a glistening milk white sea. Not the usual vivid green-fire phosphorescence that is occasionally seen in tropic waters, but a sea of foamy, pure-white milk that was luminous enough to light up our top-hamper. There was none of the ordinary sparkling phosphorescence about it. It was just a shining pure white, as brilliant as a beaded movie screen. The surface appeared foamy; a solid unbroken white clear to the horizon, which was a sharp line against the overcast of the sky that looked inky-black in constrast. This white area was roughly oval in shape, lying NE and SW, and about 30 by 40 miles in extent. Its axis lay approximately 21 deg 30'N., 115 deg 00' E. to 22 deg 10' N., 115 deg 30' E. This area was visible more than 20 miles away, a clear streak on the horizon, as though the thick overcast was lifting to show the sky. The sea was smooth. A gentle to moderate breeze blew from the north. The sky was overcast. Temperature: sea 75 deg F. to 77 deg F. at intake, air 63 deg.  We passed through the extreme northern edge of this same patch, eastbound, March 21 around 2 a.m., where the water was merely a dirty white at the ship but the whole southern horizon held a glow like dawn. Thick overcast. Temperature: sea 70 deg, air 63 deg. In this part of the China Sea, at and near the edge of the continental shelf, where the colder northern waters meet and mingle with the tropic sea, I have often seen green-fire phosphorescence in bands, and also alternating bands of dirty-white and black water spaced evenly and regularly about a hundred yards apart; but this was the first time in more than 40 years at sea that I have seen a solid shining milk-white sea.

The vessel ran into an area of phosphorescence, at least 20 miles across from E-W. A sample of water was obtained and found to contain hundreds of small luminous marine life known as plankton.

Air and sea temperatures fell rapidly from 89 deg F and 79 deg to 83 deg and 75 deg respectively on entering the area. Air temperature at 0000 on 30th was 81 deg while sea temperature remained constant.

At 1823 milky phosphorescence was observed of a slight greenish colour, which had the same light value as the sky so that the horizon was difficult to discern. At 1830 the phenomenon brightened to a full milk-white. Spray looked darker than the surrounding sea. At 2004 the luminous appearance of the sea ceased abruptly, although a glow could be seen in the sky ahead. The appearance of the sea at 1823 and 1830 was repeated at 2023 and 2045 respectively. The full milk-white appearance reached maximum brightness at 2103 when the horizon was very sharply defined. At 2133 the brightness commenced to fade again until the light values of sea and sky were the same. More variations of brightening and fading occurred again from 2200 to 2203, but at 2219 the phosphorescence brightened so that the horizon was easily discernible, and these conditions remained much the same until 2320 when it all ceased abruptly. Maximum brightness occurred at 2310. Further patches of milky phosphorescence of moderate brightness were seen at 2345; these patches became continuous at about 0010, when the horizon was easily discernible until daybreak. It was noted that the phosphorescence was not carried aboard by spray, this appeared dark against the background of the sea. During the brightest periods the phosphorescence completely masked the wave crests and gave the sea an appearance of unnatural calm at once belied by wind, motion of the ship and spray coming aboard. Wind w-sw, strong breeze to moderate gale, rough sea, moderate swell. Visibility clear, no moon. Position of ship at 1823: 11 deg 48'N, 56 deg 03'E; at 0200: 13 deg 02'N, 54 deg 22'E	Mar.

At first the sea around the ship was observed to be light green in colour, which seemed to be in large patches. At 2005 several points of light appeared in the sea about 500 yd ahead of the ship. These points suddenly increased in size and formed circles about 300-400 ft in diameter. Within these circles the sea was a very bright milky-white, which faded to a faint glow as the ship passed by and disappeared as the patches fell astern. The last patch was seen at 2014 and disappeared at 2015. Sky cloudless, good visibility. Air temp. 79 def F, sea 83 deg. Position of ship: 15 deg 55'N., 59 deg 06'E.	Mar.

At 0305 G.M.T. a brilliant display of phosphorescence was seen which was quite breathtaking in its intensity. At first a faint and uniform luminosity covered the sea surface, which later became a blaze of vivid lights twinkling and flashing in an amazing manner, and of sufficient intensity to illuminate the ship's side. By 0330 the phosphorescence had disappeared. During the period of activity it was noticed that there was a strong smell as of stagnant seaweed. Air temp 68 deg F, sea 72 deg--a rise of 4 deg in the past 6 hours. Position of ship: 12 deg 18'N., 17 deg 36'W.	Mar. Obs.  1958, 04, Vol XXVIII, no 180	West Africa	(?)	1	N/A	107

Between 0300 and 1200 G.M.T. very marked phosphorescence was observed in the sea. Large blobs of luminescence up to about 6 in. in diameter were frequently seen while the whole surface of the sea, as far as the horizon, appeared to glow with a sickly green light. Phosphorescence was also quite noticeable in the swimming pool, which is kept continuously full by means of the deck service line. The log line appeared to drip bluish-green fire as it tightened and slackened in the water. The display ceased exceedingly abruptly as though a switch had been turned off, instead of fading away gradually as is often the case. Position of ship at 0600 G.M.T.: 10 deg 54'S, 138 deg 24'W.	Mar.

Between 0315 and 0340 S.M.T., the vessel passed through an area of phosphorescence. The sea changed gradually from its normal black appearance to a milky white or pearly grey, so nearly the same shade as the sky that it was impossible to distinguish the horizon, which both before and after crossing the area was clearly defined. Although the whole sea appeared light, it was not highly luminous, as occasional specks of phosphorescence showed up clearly against it, but it was sufficiently bright to cause wave crests and the bow wave to appear a dull, dirty white. In spite of the fact that wave crests were to be seen, the sea as a whole was smoother during the passage of this area than elsehwere, and the vessel only once shipped spray, whereas, before and after, she frequently shipped both spray and light water along the weather side.

At 0230 G.M.T. a milky white glow was observed on the sea surface, in the form of a band about 200 ft across and stretching for approximately 3 miles in an E.-W. direction. When the ship cut across the band the sea did not break up into phosphorescence, nor did the light from an Aldis lamp have any effect when shone upon it. The echo sounder revealed no sign of any fish: the depth of the water was 48 fm. Air temp. 74 deg F., sea 80 deg. Wind S., force 3. Overcast with rain showers. Sea slight.

Long bands of milky phosphorescence were observed between 1630 and 1700 G.M.T. As the first of them appeared, the rather bright phosphorescenct glow on the sea, which had been present since twilight, disappeared. The vessel passed through six bands at 2032, 2037, 2042 1/2, 2051, 2057, and 2102 G.M.T respectively. Each was between 50 and 70 ft wide and, as they passed, small, twinkling spots, rather like stars, were seen. The bands seemed to be quite straight to the northward, but to the S. they were wavy looking and, near thehorizon they curved towards the W. They were estimated to extend about 5 or 6 miles on either side of the ship. Air temp 78 deg F, sea 80 deg. Wind, light airs. Slight E'ly swell. Speed of vessel 10.7 kt.

03/03/1959	20:00 GMT	03/04/1959	00:00 GMT	21 deg 28' N	61 deg 18' E	MV British Purpose	D. C. Williams, Second Officer	3rd March, 1959, at 2000 G.M.T. The vessel was passing through normal phosphorescence only visible in her own wash. This brilliance slowly increased and at about 2100 the sea all round the ship began to sparkle. This effect was due to thousands of little momentary splashed of phosphorescence close to the ship, which appeared to be caused by the rapid movement of small fish or other creatures, as some splashes of light had short tails but each was visible for only an instant. At any one time there were thousands of time visible and this persisted until well after 2400. By 2145 they had attained a brilliance difficult to believe, almost like burning magnesium, also the vessel's bow wave was dazzling and by its light it was possible to read. At 2155 the vessel crossed a single band of phosphorescence. This was visible for at least a mile, lying in an E.-W. direction and varying in width from 50-100 ft. It was very dull compared with the other illuminations with a steady even glow. As the vessel passed through it, the bow wave did not vary in brilliance at all. Soon after this the general brilliance began to decrease very slowly. The moon, in its last quarter, rose at 2230. At 2300 the bow wave of another vessel proveeding in the opposite direction could be clearly seen at over 7 miles with binoculars. At 2345 a light NW. breeze sprang up and the moon became quite bright but this is no way affected the general display. Small waves formed but did not break. Prior to this, apart from the vessel's wash, there had been absolutely no movement of the sea surface. The sample of sea water taken, when placed in an enamel bucket and agitated, glowed brilliantly and each independent speck of phosphorescence could be seen. Traces of phosphorescence were visible in the sample for two days. Unfortunately the bottle containing it was subsequently smashed. Position of ship at 2200: 21 deg 28'N., 61 deg 18'E.	Mar.

At 1100 G.M.T. the sea ahead was seen to be brilliantly lit up and at 1115 the vessel entered an area of phosphorescence, which, from a distance, bore a resemblance to sea fog. From horizon to horizon, the entire sea appeared to be milky white, having an intensity which varied from place to place. Numerous patches of bright phosphorescence were observed in the bow wave. A sample of water was taken in a bucket and when examined in the dark a great number of minute organisms were seen in suspension, apparently stationary. When the surface of the water was agitated the brilliance increased and the small particles clustered together to form patches about one inch in diameter. The brilliance was maintained for 30-40 min, but, after an hour nothing more could be seen. The ship remained in the milky sea until 1400, the phosphorescence gradually becoming weaker, until only occasional patches showed in the bow wave. From 1115 to 140, the distance steamed was 33 miles. The sea temp. remained constant at 78.5 deg F. Wind ESE, force 4; sea slight to moderate. Position of ship: 8 deg 45'S., 128 deg 47'E. (15 miles south of Sermata Island). [There is a note from E.W. Barlow where he doubts this is a true milky sea because the bucket observations hints the colour of the sea was green but due to the low intensity of the light appeared white. I am not sure why the bucket observation supports this conclusion.]	Mar. Obs. 1960, 07, Vol XXX, no 189	Arafura Sea	Milky Sea	0	N/A	115

At 2100 GMT entered a field of phosphorescence which gave the ocean a milky white icy appearance. Wave crests were difficult to distinguish breaking, even close to the ship. On leaving the field at 2210, the horizon showed as a bright ring. Ten minutes later the vessel re-entered phosphorescence; this faded at 2230. Posn 11 deg 28' N, 54 deg 06' E.	E.W.

At 2200 GMT, while rounding Ras al Hadd at a distance of 5 miles, the vessel passed through a large area of 'white water', in which there were numerous spots of bright light reminiscent of fairy lights. The most concentrated areas of phosphorescence seemed to lie towards the coast and parallel with it, between Ras al Khabba and Ras al Hadd: it was also present in several bands which stretched away from the coast. Phosphorescence was still seen when north of Ras al Hadd but it presented no unusual features. Sea temp. 74 deg F.; wind, light and variable. Position of ship: 22 deg 30'N, 59 deg 51'E.

Between 0120 and 0130 GMT the vessel passed through an area of intense phosphorescence in which there were patches of 'milky sea' and bright flashing lights: in other parts the phosphorescence showed a steady glow. Wave tops were clearly visible when they broke, emitting a greenish light, and the bow wave of a ship two miles away was plainly seen. Echo soundings showed no bottom when in the area, but soon after leaving it the depth changed quickly from 80 to 50 fm. Sea temp. 60 deg F. Position of ship: 11 deg 10'N, 17 deg 16'W.	Mar.

At 2019 SMT (1249 GMT), whilst on a course of 160 deg at 15 kt., the ship crossed a slightly irregular but clearly defined line on the sea surface. Beyond the line, which lay approx. E-W, the surface seemed to be uniform grey. No effect on the steering was noticed but the sea temp. dropped from 81 deg F at 2000 to 76 deg at 2030. As the ship proceeded, they grey colour gradually brightened to a milky shade and even seemed to glow faintly. It was at its brightest at 2050 approx., when it seemed that the air was reflecting a little radiance. At no time did the ship become illuminated by the glow; it fact it seemed darker by contrast. Around 2050 some of the more usual forms of phosphorescence appeared: 'spangles' and 'underwater explosions' in the ship's wash. The main phenomenon was unaffected by the disturbed water except that the edges of the wash looked dark as though the milky colour was all on the surface and was being pushed aside to show the normal colour underneath. After the peak of brightness was passed the colour changed rapidly to a dull grey but it was not until after 2300 that the last traces disappeared. By this time the sea temperature had risen to 78 deg. A sample was taken at 2040 and was found to contain hair-like object, khaki in colour, about 1/2 in. long. They were not thickly clustered. When the phenomenon was ifrst observed the ship was 20 miles from the 100 fm. line, in a charted depth of 1,200 fm. A westerly set of 1/2-1 1/2 kt. was experienced that night and the following day.

From 0130 SMT onwards, when the ship was about 90 miles east of Ceylon, the colour of the sea changed to a milky grey which gradually became a brilliant off-white, rather suggestive of a snow covered plain. during the period of greatest brightness it was possible to read a book on the wing of the bridge. Spots of bright red light were seen close to the ship when an Aldis lamp was directed on to the sea surface. As the sea was white and the ship and sky both very dark, the impression gained was that everything was being seen in negative. Some low, black-looking Cu. were visible in the north-west. The whole effect was rather ghostly and only once before, off the south coast of Japan, had I seen anything similar. On that occasion the phosphorescence was perhaps more brilliant, but it was not so complete in coverage as in the present instance. Wind, light and variable. Sea smooth with long low swell from NE.

At about 0200 GMT during heavy continuous rain and reduced visibility, there was seen about a mile ahead what appeared to be a fog bank. The night was very dark with a heavily overcast sky making this whitish-looking patch easily discernible. On closer approach, the look-out on the forecastle head reported the patch as ice, but when the vessel entered the area thin lines or shreds of phosphorescent material were found to be floating on, or near, the surface of the sea. The whole area, about 1/4 mile long and 100 yd. wide emitted a dull green-white glow. Other similar smaller patches were seen during the following three hours. The shreds of material were probably less than 1 in. across and varied in length from 1 to 4 ft. They lay in a direction 040 deg-220 deg, their distance apart being from 6 in. to 4 ft.: at close quarters the shreds resembled small then neon lights. Sea tmep. 38 deg F.

During the middle watch on a clear moonless night with excellent visibility the vessel passed through a large area of sea with unusual milky white appearance, which stretched as far as the eye could see, giving a good firm horizon. At times the whiteness was so pronounced that the bow wave and breaking seas were barely discernable. No unusual amount of surface phosphorescence was present although occasional flecks were seen in the water alongside the ship. A bucket of water drawn from overside proved on examination to have no foreign matter suspended in it and was of normal temperature and density. In this area sometime ago a similar observation was made, but at that time the bow wave and breaking seas appeared black.	Letter to Dr. Kay	Java	Milky Sea	0	N/A	123

The circle, about 300 feet in diameter, consisted of a band of phosphorescence about 50 feet in width form a complete circle around a dark and clear patch of water about 200 feet in diameter. About half a mile further the vessel passed through another band of phosphorescence, again about 50 feet in width, forming a curved segment of a circle over an arc of approximately 90 deg, the band being about 600 feet in length.

Between 1915 to 2100 S.M.T. during the twilight period, the whole sea surface became light and luminous. This brightness and the colour of the sea matched exactly with that of the sky and as a result the horizon became hazy and afterwards faded out completely. The 'White Horses' previously seen also disappeared and whole atmosphere became milky white, giving an appearance of thick fog. After about an hour, the sea became brighter compared to the darkening sky and the horizon could be made out again. The brightness was even all over the sea surface and it appered like a ground glass illuminated from underneath. This phenomenon lasted for another half hour after which the brightness started reducing. By 2100 S.M.T. the sea became normal again. No usual phosphorescence was seen that night. The sky was overcast, southwesterly wind, Force 4 to 5 throughout. There was no change in air or sea temperatures. Dry Bulb 25 deg C, Wet Bulb 23.3 deg C, Sea Temp 25.6 deg C.

Persian Gulf towards Suez. 23rd August, 1963 (confirmed 1963) at 2215 G.M.T. in 17 deg 58'N, 58 deg 08'E to 24th August, 1963, at 0005 in 17 deg 26'N, 58 deg 08'E. Vessel steaming south into rough head sea and swell, visibility approximately 7-8 miles, wind 190 deg 18 knots. At about 2215 G.M.T. it was noticed that a band of light very similar to ice blink was illuminating the horizon ahead of the ship. From 2215 until 2240 the low stratus clouds which had persisted all day dispersed until there were only a few scattered cumulus in the sky. At 2245 the sea around the ship became a light grey in colour and hazy in appearance. It was thought at first to be low fog, but there was no loom around any of the ship's lights and a light shone into the water indicated none. Stars low on the horizon were clearly visible. As the vessel steamed on the fog effect thickened and seemed to rise, masking the horizon ahead of the ship, at the same time the sea all around became pure white in colour. The fog effect was so strong by 2300 that the master ordered the radar to be switched on. Between 2300 and 2320 the fog effect thinned and finally disappeared but the sea remained the pure white colour. The horizon was clearly visible at 2330 as a firm line of contrast between the white sea and the dark sky. Even though the phenomenon was visible as far as the horizon, there was no apparent illuminating effect from it. The ship's hull and rigging were clearly silhouetted against the sea, yet no details could be picked out. The effect can be likened to being in snow on a dark clear night, where everything is silhouetted and yet no details are visible. The bow wave was barely visible and the rest of the sea appeared a uniform white with no signs of breaking waves visible. Occasional blobs of phosphorescence in the bow wave showed up just as clearly on a normal dark moonless night. A bucket of sea water revealed nothing to the naked eye, yet when agitated a few small specks of phosphorescence were visible. At 2340 G.M.T. a band of dark coloured water was seen in the south east, which soon covered the horizon ahead of the ship and at 2344 the ship passed through this band which was approximately 500 yards wide and then back into the white water once more.

An approximate measurement of said patch would be 1/4 mile in length and several hundred yards wide. The life of the presumed phosphorescence was about 6 minutes after which it gradually died away until no signs remained.

Large patches of phosphorescence were observed again of two types. First had bright white specks which appeared at ship's side and stretched about 100 yards outward. The second were long large patches with a milky appearance stretching as far as the eye could see. The impression given was that of running into surf. When the lamp was shone on the water, it appeared as if there was a large amount of weed in the water. A sample of water was taken in a plastic bucket but no weed was present. Bright specks were observed in the bucket but on shinint light into the bucket these disappeared. Sky was cloudless with no moon.	Letter to Dr. Kay	West Africa	Milky Sea	0	N/A	132

This phenomenon was observed from the port side of the bridge and appeared to stretch some 400-450 feet to port. It was seen to stretch to starboard for an indeterminate distance. As the vessel passed through, the phosphorescence could be seen to be made up of millions of tiny fragments, which gave off quite an appeciable light. This light, when first observed, gave the appearance of a disturbed sea, white in colour, but this colour turned greenish as the vessel passed through and returned to white again on clearing astern.

Passed through a large belt of phosphorescence about 1 1/2 miles across and stretching as far as the eye could see in a NW-SE direction. The sea appeared milky white and the general impression was of a snow covered field on a moonlight night. The "belt" was first noticed some 2 miles off when the look-out reported several ships ahead (there turned out to be small breaking waves), the sea and horizon blended and it appeared as if the bows were lifting as the ship approached the clearly defined extermity of the belt. On entering the belt everything took on a greenish white appearance and the bridge was lit by a glow from the sea, small breaking waves appeared as white flashes of luminosity.

The width of the area affected by the phosphorescence was estimated to be from approximately 3 miltes to the north-east of the vessel to a similar distance to the south-west of the vessel. The length of the affected area was 7 miles measured by log. The area affected by the phosphorescence was quite distinct, appearing as a lighter, rather milky colour, against the background of a much darker sea. No change in sea temperature (75.5 deg) was observed either on entering the phosphorescence nor on leaving same. On leaving the area of phosphorescence at 1725 GMT, a very distinct demarcation line was observed between the region of phosphorescence and the unaffected sea area. Observed by Mr. J. L.

Immediately above this band was another, of greater vertical extend, black, resembling low stratiform cloud. At 0045 the ship entered an area of "white" water which appeared to be the type of bioluminescence known as "milky sea". The dividing line between this and unaffected sea water was clearly marked and extended roughly N-S as far as the eye could see, the land being 11 miles to the south. The diffused white light was bright enough to show up the silhouette of an unlit passing dhow. The phenomenon faded as dawn approached so that the westerly limit was not observed. On shining the signalling lamp on the sea during the phenomenon, minute yellow particles, similar to the red particles seen in other types of bioluminescence, were observed. No phosphorescence was observed in the immediate vicinity of the eastern limit. The black cloud effect dissipated on closing with the "milky sea". A sample of the water was preserved.

The horizon, which previously had been very firm became blurred and then disappeared altogether. As we approached it appeared as though we were coming into a bank of fog. On entering the "fog" it turned out that the water was "lit up" as though a light had been turned on under the sea. It stretched over the ocean as far as the eye could see. As we proceeded, the sea became brighter giving the effect of ice. I shone the Aldis light on the sea but it appeared quite normal and green in colour. A sample of the water looked clear and normal. It also tasted quite normal. At 1950 a distinct line of demarcation, running north and south was seen. On our side the sea was bright and on the other it was black. At 1955 we crossed this line back into normal water. On looking astern it looked as there there was white mist along the demarcation line. The night was exceptionally bright, no moon and cloudless. (Observed by Mr. I. G. Tew, Third Officer and Mr. D. McSwann, Quarter Master). At 2040 GMT on the same night in 15 deg 46'N, 57 deg 26'E the vessel again ran into an area of luminescent water, stretching from horizon to horizon. The appearance of the water, milky-white and opague, was identical to that of smaller patches of luminescence frequently seen in these waters. Neither the shining of the Aldis lamp nor the switching on of the radar produced any signs of activity in the water. The western edge of the area was reached at 2056 GMT and again showed a clear line of demarcation running north and south. Another vessel's steaming lights (radar distance off, 9 miles) were clearly visible throughout the time the vessel was in the area. The other thing of note about the occurrence was a distinct "musty" smell while the vessel was passing through the luminescent area. At 2059 GMT and for 2 minutes, marked phosphorescence was seen in the bow wave (observed by Mr. P. G. Pike, Second Officer).	Letter to Dr. Kay	Somalia/Socotra	Milky Sea	0	N/A	141

Particles of phosphorescence were abundant in vessel's bow wave but not outside of it. These conditions continued until 1520 GMT when the effect of the Milky sea slowly reduced to normal conditions at 1640. A lamp was flashed across the sea but no effect was observed.

Whilst the sky was dark, there being no moon and about 4/8th cloud, the whole surface of the sea around the ship suddenly began to glow, gradually getting brighter until at about 1145 GMT the whole of the surface of the sea, as far as the eye could see, was glowing brightly as if by some inherent green light. This did not appear to be the usual phosphorescence which seems to scintillate, but glowed steadily as though green neon lights were alight just under the surface of the sea. The sides of the ship seemed to light up and a bucket full of water was obtained from over side. Whilst the captain and myself were examining water in bucket for signs of marine life, a crew member who had been looking down on us from the deck above, stated that the water in the bucket was glowing. This was not apparent to the Captain or myself, who were of course much closer to the water in the bucket. The water in the bucket appeared to be clear. This luminescence laster for three hours until 1400 GMT being brightest at 1145, then very gradually declined in brightness until it disappeared. During this period, the following observations were made: wind SE 17 mph, air temperature 77 deg, wet bulb 72 deg, sea temperature 77 deg. Course of ship 120 deg, barometer 29.80 inches. Visibility appeared to have been a little better than five miles with a hazy atmosphere. The Master, Captain Rowe and Mr. D.

Om +/- 20.15 EW. werd de zee melkwit, wat met de overeenkomstige tint van de bewolking de indruk gaf, dat een dichte mist werd ingevaren. De bewolking bestond op dat moment uit Stratus en Stratocumulus 8. Wolkenbasis geschat op +/- 200 meter. In het begin gaf een ander een spookachtige, bijna angstwekkende indruk, temeer daar het doodstil was; ondanks windkracht 3 á 4 aanvankelijk, was de zee bijna spiegelglad, behoudens een lage matig lange zuidelijke deining. Het verschijnsel wekte ook de indruk, dat door een sneeuwlandschap werd gevaren. Een andere vergelijking: een vliegtuig in een witte wolk. Vrij snel were vastgesteld, dat men hier niet te maken had met mist. Het zoeklicht werd opgetuigd en bij beschijning van het wateroppervlak, lichtten talrijke deeltjes (diertjes?) rood op. In mindere mate kwamen ook groene en witte deeltjes voor. Gedurende het verschijnsel was het normale lichten van de zee minder geworden. De deeltsjes schenen zich sprongsweijs voort te bewegen. De modelijkheid is echter niet uitgesloten, dat deze "sprongetjes" door de boeggolf werden veroorzaakt. In ieder geval werd geconsstateerd dat wind en zee geen invloed haddden op de voortbeweging van de deeltjes. Tegen 22.30 begonnen zee en wolken weer langzaam hun normale aanzien te herkrijgen. Om 23.00 was alles weer normaal. De rode deeltjes waren er nog steeds, doch minder talrijk dan eerst. Om 23.30 begon de totaal bewolkte hemel eruit te zien alsof de ochtendschemering langzaam intrad recht vooruit. De zee had echter nog steeds de normale donkere kleur met alleen de groen fluorescerende boeggolf. Om 23.45 werd de zee wederom melkwit nu echter binnen een tijdsbestek van één minuut, terwijl de eerste maal de varandering geleidelijk was ingetreden. De rood lichtende deeltjes kwamen weer veelvuldig voor. Tegen 00.50 begon het verschijnsel weer af te nemen, terwijl tevens de bewolking even brak. Te 01.00 wederom de volle intensiteit, zelfs not helderkder dan voorheen. Van 01.20 tot 01.40 werd alles geleidelijk minder om bijna geheel to verdwijnen. Om 2.30 wederom bovenvermelde verschijnselen. Om 04.15 begon het te regenen en om 04.20 begon de zee weer het normale anzien te krijgen. Om 04.35 was alles weer normaal. Om 04.45 was ook de regenbui afgelopen. Echter om 04.40 werd waargenomen, dat de kim aan bakboord +/- 2 strenaar achteren. Om 04.45 is de plek dwarsop. Om 05.30 is ook dit verschijnsel verdwenen.

Townsville towards Djibouti. 3rd August 1965 between 1900 and 2100 GMT whilst the vessel was some 50 miles off the southwest tip of the Indonesian Island of Sumba (position at 1800 GMT was 10 deg 12'S, 120 deg 00'E). The phenomenon known as 'milky sea' was observed. The horizon was quite clear throughout the period but although there was a force 4 breeze from the east, no disturbance of the sea could be seen other than that immediately surrounding the ship. The air temperature was 75 deg and the sea temperature 79 deg and the sky was cloudless. Observed by Mr. M. J. Butler, Chief Officer	Letter to Dr. Kay	Java	Milky Sea	0	N/A	145
08/04/1965	23:00 GMT	08/05/1965	00:00 GMT	12 deg 30' N	56 deg 30' E	MV Glenfalloch (19243)	(?)	Panang towards Aden. 4th-5th August 1965 in 12 deg 30'N, 56 deg 30'E. At 0200 ship's time with a fresh SW monsoon blowing and the night being dark, the horizon suddenly paled and soon the ship was passing through luminous sea. It was as if the water was in a palely floodlit swimming pool; so clear it was, and very much lighter than the sky. As the waves broke, they shone clear white, but not brilliantly as in a phosphorescent sea. This phenomenon lasted for about an hour, finishing as quickly as it came.

08/07/1965	22:20 UNK	08/07/1965	23:10 UNK	11 deg 50' N	59 deg 00' E	MV Delphic (19570)	Captain G. A. Borthwick, Mr. M. Sargeant, Second Officer and Mr. E. Glover, Cadet	Djibouti towards Colombo. 7th August 1965 in 11 deg 50'N, 59 deg 00'E. Marked phosphorescence of the white water type observed from 2220-2230 and from 2250-2310. In each case the effect was produced and terminated gradually although towards the end of each period the line of darked water would be seen advancing from the south-eastward. At the height of luminescence in both cases the effect extended to the lmit of visibility and the light contrast between sea and sky appeared to be reversed ie the sea appeared to be much lighter in tone than the sky and the overall effect of the sea and sky was that of a black and while photographic negative. The horizon was quite clearly defined against the sky. The moon had set about one hour previously and apart from starlight the night was black. During the phenomenon, the sea appeared in a greenish-white colour and somewhat turbid. The bow waves and breaking waves in the vicinity were still clearly visible although at a much reduced contrast with the sea to that produced under normal conditions. The light produced was not of sufficient intensity to cause relfection aboard the vessel. Sea temperature readings indicated a rise in temperature of 2 deg during the periods of the phenomenon. The use of radar did not produce any further phenomenon and the Aldis light had no effect either. Observed by Captain G. A. Borthwick, Mr. M. Sargeant, Second Officer and Mr. E Glover, Cadet.

Grundry, Third Officer. 19th August 1965 at 1900 GMT in 8 deg 57' S, 40 deg 22'E. Passed through a vast area of coloured water. At 1915 the sea was a light grey colour and appeared to extend all round the ship to the limits of the visible horizon. The loom of the moon was faintly visible to port during this time and from 1700 GMT. A sample of water was taken and in a glass appeared to have no colour at all but when the Aldis light was shone on the sea, the latter appeared a gray-green colour. The whole effect with the total darkness of the sky was as if the ship were passing through an ice field on a dark night. No sparkle of phosphorescence was observed.

08/21/1965	16:45 GMT	08/21/1965	16:48 GMT	10 deg 02' N	60 deg 36' E	MV Afric (19565)	Mr. W. M. Douglas, Third Officer and Mr. M. Doyle, Radio Officer	Captain P. K. Murchison, Aden towards Colombo. 21st August 1965 at 1645 GMT in 10 deg 02'N, 60 deg 36' E. Initially a thin green line was observed near the horizon, similar in structure if not in colour to a moonlit horizon on a cloudy night, having a definite limit and apparently several miles away. Above was observed what appeared to be a very large black cumulonimbus cloud mass as one would expect with an approaching storm. Within one minute of the initial observation, the whole sea was illuminated with a phosphorescent lighting allowing wave structures to be observed almost as far as is possible in daylight. No individual brighter portions were present as in a wake or bow wave, the whole sea emitted light as might a luminous paint. The bow wave itself was lit with a bluish tinge and the sky darkened and only the brighter stars were visible. Within 3 minutes, the phenomenon had passed and the phosphorescent perimeter line passed astern, against the wind, at a far greater speen that that of the ship through the water and rapidly disappeared. Observation then showed the sky to be 2/8th clouded, with cumulus cloud only. No storm clouds were present. The moon had not risen. Sea temperature 78 deg. Observed by Mr. W.M. Douglas, Third Officer and Mr. M. Doyle, Radio Officer.	Letter to Dr. Kay	Somalia/Socotra	Milky Sea	0	N/A	148

Jardine, Senior Third Officer. 21st August 1965 at 2230 GMT in 39 deg 45'N, 9 deg 24'W. Entered a large area of bright phosphorescence. On approaching the area it appeared so bright as to give the appearance of a fog bank, the sky being overcast and the moon not yet risen. A sample of sea water was taken but no living organisms were evident to the naked eye. At one stage fish were observed to be rising but by the time an Adlis lamp was shone they had stopped and size could not be ascertained. The water did not react to the shining of the Aldis Lamp	Letter to Dr. Kay	North of Lisbon in Portugal	?	2	N/A	146
08/22/1965	15:30 GMT	08/22/1965	(?)	12 deg 06' N	57 deg 36' E	MV Cardiganshire (19324)	(?)	Trincomalee towards Aden. 22nd August 1965 at 1530 GMT in 12 deg 06'N, 57 deg 36'E. Marine bioluminescence was observed. Wind SW Force 6, rough sea, heavy swell, cloudless sky. Sea temperature 78 deg. The bioluminescence appeared to be in the form of an even white luminescence a few feet above the sea surface. These conditions prevailed for about one hour before gradually fading away; during this time the luminescence stretched to the horizon in all directions. The radar was switched on but had no apparent effect upon the phenomenon. The Aldis lamp was played on the sea surface but this also had no visible effect. At 1830 GMT the same day in 12 deg 17'N, 56 deg, 55'E, further marine bioluminescence was encountered similar to the luminescence previously observed except that instead of fading gradually as the first area of bioluminescence did, the second area ended abruptly at a clearly defined line.

Remarkable luminosity of the sea was observed. The whole sea glowed with a pale green light which was sufficiently strong to make detection of wave crests impossible (wind force 5). None of the usual signs of phosphorescence such as sparkling particles in the bow wave were visible. The intensity of the glow varied somehwat over the period and disappeared at 17:30 GMT.

08/27/1965	20:25 GMT	08/27/1965	21:15 GMT	16 deg 02' N	60 deg 26' E	SS City of Pretoria (19462)	Mr. W. Donn, Junior Second Officer, and Mr. C. L. Knowles, Third Officer	Captain C. B. Parks Bradbury, Aden towards Bombay. 27th August 1965 in 16 deg 02'N, 60 deg 26'E, speed 14.8 knots. Since sunset a marked, though pale, phosphorescent glow had been visible in the bow wave of the vessel and the numerous "white horses" on the sea surface. At 2025 GMT the vessel entered an area of water, the whole surface of which was lit by phosphorescence. It gave the sea a "milky" appearance and the diffused light was uniform in intensity to the horizon (it appeared, although there was no means of checking it, that the visible horizon was much reduced). When the ship's Aldis lamp (36 watts) was switched on and directed at the sea surface, at varying distances, no visual change in illuminosity could be seen. A sample of the sea water taken in the insulated bucket showed no signs of organic matter; sharp agitation of the bucket produced no light whatsoever. The vessel cleared the area of milky water at 2115 GMT. Observed by Mr. W. Donn, Junior Second Officer and Mr. C. L. Knowles, Third Officer.	Letter to Dr. Kay	Somalia/Socotra	Milky Sea	0	N/A	146

Large patches of phosphoresecence observed on water during the evening. At one stage all the visible sea to the horizon around the ship was glowing creating a smokey effect and giving the impression of poor visibility. Moderate to rough sea, moderate swell. Wind SSW force 5.	Letter to Dr. Kay	Somalia/Socotra	Milky Sea	0	N/A	146
08/29/1965	21:00 GMT	08/29/1965	21:30 GMT	11 deg 10' N	61 deg 02' E	MV Benarmin (19657)	(?)	29th August 1965 in 11 deg 10'N, 61 deg 02'E. For half an hour between 2100 and 2130 GMT the whole sea from ship to horizon was glowing with a brownish-green luminescence. There was no moon at the time yet the line of the horizon was clearly seen. The luminescence was so bright that masts and superstructure were discernible from the glow. Although there was a 16 knot wind blowing, the white horses could not be distinguished in the uniform effect. This phenomenon seemed to be deep in the water and was unlike normal phosphorescence. After the luminescence cleared, normal white horse phosphorescence returned.	Letter to Dr. Kay	Somalia/Socotra	Milky Sea	0	N/A	146
09/03/1965	19:30 GMT	09/03/1965	22:00 GMT	9 deg 30' N	54 deg 25' E	SS Persic (19749)	(?)	Djibouti towards Fremantle. 3rd September 1965 between 1930 and 2200 GMT in 9 deg 30'N, 54 deg 25' E. Sea brilliantly illuminated by luminosity, horizon clearly defined, with glow extending to about 5 degrees above horizon. There was no phosphorescent effect, the sea appearing lifeless despite moderate sea running at the time. However, sea samples taken at hourly intervals were brilliantly phosphorescent when poured on to the deck, the bright particles remaining until the water reached the scupper. The whole effect did not grow and then diminish, but began and ended abruptly.	Letter to Dr. Kay	Somalia/Socotra	Milky Sea	0	N/A	149
07/16/1966	03:50 UNK	07/16/1966	05:15 UNK	6 deg 52' S	98 deg 04' W	MV Port Wyndham (20313)	Mr. C. Allport, Junior Third Officer	Lyttelton to Panama. 16th July 1966 in 6 deg 52'S, 98 deg 04'W, whilst steering a course of 59 deg at 13.5 knots. Two distinct patches of bioluminescence of the type usually called "white water" were observed. The first patch was encountered between 0350 and 0515 by Mr. C. Allport, Junior Third Officer, who reports the following: The vessel passed into a very extensive area of milky green water and the demarcation line between the normal coloured water and this milky water was very distinct, being visible on both sides of the ship. There was what appeared to be a phosphorescent mist above the surface of the sea and rapid flashed of bioluminescence were observed at a considerable distance from the ship. The Aldis lamp was flashed on the surface of the sea but had no apparent effect on the bioluminescence. The second patch was encountered from 0730 to 0830 by Mr. D. Parsons, Third Officer, and was as described above although the line of demarcation was not so distinct when the vessel passed out of the bioluminescence as when she entered it. A difference of opinion exists over the phosphorescent mist reported during the first observation and in the second observation may well have been the light being given off by the water made the sky and sea fuse together leaving virtually no horizon and thus giving the impression of reduced visibility. There was no appreciable difference in condition from those before the bioluminescence was encountered during either period and they were as follows: Wind ESE force 4, dry bulb 73 deg, wet bulb 70 deg, dew point 68 deg, sea temperature 73 deg, overcast and fine. A sample of sea water was collected during the first observation and an attempt to preserve this had been made by boiling it and adding methylated spirit, since no formalin is available.

Varende in de Indische Oceaan, op weg van Sydney naar Sumatra, werd het volgende verschijnsel waargenomen. Te 12.15 werd de zee in het Noordelijk en in het Ooseltijk kwadrant grijsachtig tot wit. De eerste indruk was; Mist. Te meer daar de bewolking zich hoofdzakelijk aan de horizon bevond. Hierna lostte het verschijnsel zich op, het zicht werd weer normaal, dit was te 12.40. Te 12.55 werd hetzelfde verschijnsel waargenomen in het Westelijk kwadrant. In de boeggolf werden paars fluorescerende punten waargenomen. Afgezien van de witte kleur was er geen bijzondere verkleuring van het water te bemerken. Vanaf 14.30 was het verschijnsel niet meer waar te nemen vanwege de opkomst van de maan. Het is niet uitgesloten dat het nog enige tijd aanwezig geweest is. T droge bol: 24.8. T natte bol: 22.0. dauwpunt: 21. Wind: Richting: 140; snelheid: 16. T water: 25.0. Barometer: 1014.0.

Wind 220 deg force 7-8, sea rough, heavy swell, air temperature 79 deg, sea temperature 76 deg, sunset at 1442 GMT. A mist showed as a luminous glow, first in patches and then covering the whole sea. It reached a height of approximately 3 feet above the sea surface. The mist and sea surface were several shades lighter in contrast to the sky, the sea being pale green in colour and the mist an even lighter green. No effect was observed when the Aldis was shone into the mist or on the sea surface. No temperature changes occurred before, during or after the phenomenon. Visibility was not affected for a ship could be seen through the mist at nine miles with the naked eye.	Letter to Dr. Kay	Somalia/Socotra	Milky Sea	0	N/A	152
08/08/1966	11:00 GMT	08/08/1966	15:55 GMT	16 deg 59' S	108 deg 03' E	MV Port Huon (an Australian Selected Ship)	(?)	8th August 1966 at 1100 GMT in 16 deg 59'S, 108 deg 03'E. As darkness fell the sea was observed to be a bright greenish colour and extremely luminous, all white horses and wake becoming invisible, giving the appearance of an absolutely flat calm sea rather resembling a vast expanse of snow covered land, extending to the horizon. The light being emitted from the sea was such that all stars became invisible, no planets or moon being in the sky at that time. At 1335 the vessel passed out of this patch into normal sea water, the outer limits of the patch being well defined. From 1350 to 1430 another area was encountered exactly as the previous one, with equally well defined limits. At 1555 yet another such area was encountered but due to moon rise at 1400 further observation was impossible. At the time of the observation the vessel was steaming on a true course of 104 deg and 20 knots, the wind remaining a constant SE force 3 throughout the period and the barometer reading 1017.7 and falling flowly, showed no appreciable change in tendency. The sea and air temperature also remained constant at 74 and 73 degrees respectively. The cloud cover at first was now becoming 5/8th at moon rise. No magnetic anomaly was observed and the echo sounder, running throughout the period, showed no echo. Several samples of the sea water were obtained but on being put through several tests by engine room officers were found to be no different to ordinary sea water, however, the samples were retained in the hope of more detailed analyses later.

"Vitrea" (Shell Tankers N.V.), de heer E.L. de Ruiter, werd het navolgende rapport ontvangen m.b.t. een waarneming van het verschijnsel "melkzee" (de waarneming geschiedde door genoemde 4e stuurman en door de 3e stuurman, de heer J.P. Hendriks). Varende in de Indische Oceaan, ongeveer 240 zuid van Christmas Isl., in positie 14 deg 12' Z en 107 deg 05' O, op weg van Geelong naar Miri, werd aan boord van het ss. "Vitrea", onder gezagvoerder Th. J. v. d. Vrie, een witte melkzee waargenomen. De zee werd op de EW van 10 augustus 1966 te 20.09 scheepstijd (12.09 GMT) vrij snel geheel wit. Bij eerste oopgopslag leek het of in een sneeuwlandschap werd gevaren; ook werd eerst gedacht, dat het schip in een laaghangende mistbank was terecht gekomen. Nadat de ogen enigszins aan de toestand waren gewend, werd geconstateerd dat de zee rondom geheel wit was. Direct werden meteo-waarnemingen verricht, met onderstaand resultaat: Temperatuur drogebol: 24.8. Temperatuur nattebol: 24.0. Temperatuur zeewater: 25.3. Wind: zuidoost, kracht 3. Geen deining PPP: 1013.3. Bewolkt gedeelte: 3/8 Cm: 1 (zeer dunne Altostratus). Koers: 345 deg. Snelheid: 16 mijl per uur. Hoewel er windkract 3 was, ontstond na verloop van enige tijd een nagenoeg spiegelgladde zee. Ook het s.g. van het zeewater werd bepaald (1,026). Toen we het zoeklicht op het water lieten schijnen, lichtten talrijke deeltjes eerst zilverachtig en later roodachtig op. De bewolking nam snel af, totdat er geen bewolking meer was. Tot 22.00 bleef de zee egaal wit. Ne 22.00 kwamen er steeds meer donkere plekken. Te 22.55 was de zee weer geheel normal. Op de EW 11 augustus de zee te 21.00 weer geleide lijk wit te worden, achteruit beginnend. Wederom werden meteorwarnemingen verricht. De toestand bleef zo tot 23.10. De zee werd toen in een tijd van een halve minuut weer geheel normaal. Meteo-waarneming van 11 augustus 21.35: Temperatuur drogebol: 25.0. Temperatuur nattebol: 24.5. Temperatuur zeewater: 25.2. Wind: OZO, kracht 3. Geen deining: Geen bewolking PPP: 1009.8. Koers: 357 deg. Snelheid: 16 mijl per uur.	Tim Wyatt, Unpublished Notes/Paper	Christmas Island	Milky Sea	0	N/A	151

A glow, grey-blue in colour covers the sea all round the ship. It seems to be a fine salt spray perhaps with phosphorescent content. It looks as if it is what is called white water. The phenomenon lasted approximately 1 hour.	Letter to Dr. Kay	Somalia/Socotra	Milky Sea	0	N/A	152

The vessel was seen to be approaching an area of water appearing whitish in colour and shortly afterwards entered the area. It appeared as if the sea were being lit from below by powerful lights. The brilliance of this colour soon caused the eyes to ache if constantly focussed on the sea and a very sharp horizon could be observed between the sea and the sky. The bow wave of the ship and the crests of the breaking waves were lost entirely and this gave the effect of the sea being calm. The sea temperature was found to have risen by 8 deg since the previous observation. The effect lasted for approximately 2 1/2 hours and then slowly faded to normal over a futher 1 1/2 hour period.

Varende in de Indische Oceaan, van Sumatra naar Sydney, werd het volgende verschijnsel waargenomen. Te ongeveer 12.25 werd recht vooruit een wit schijnsel waargenomen, zo nagenoeg van hetzelfde karakter als bij ochtendschemering. Te 12.40 werd een milkachtige streep zichtbaar aan de horizon. Na verloop van tijd was het zichtbaar over de gehele horizon. In de boeggolf waren paars fluorescerende punter zichtbaar. Met behulp van seinlamp werd het wateroppervlak beschenen, de kleur in het licht was licht groen. Er was geen merkbare verandering in de zeegang waar te nemen. De paarse punten waren elk op zich zeer korte tij d zichtbaar, en gaven de indruk zich zeer snel door het water te bewegen.

A large area of intensive bioluminescence was encountered in the area between 46 deg 23' N, 18 deg 46' W and 48 deg 02'N, 16 deg 11'W. The luminescence first became visible at about 2000GMT/7 when it became truly dark. The most intense period was between this time and 2400 when the rising moon decreased the brilliance somewhat. However the luminesecence was still visible until about 0600 when increasing daylight made it invisible.	Letter to Dr. Kay	North Atlantic	Milky Sea	0	N/A	156

De bewolking bestond op dat moment uit Cumulus (CL=1) en AltoCumulus (CM=4) en het bewolkte gedeelte der lcuht bedroeg ongeveer 2/8. Tijdens de "melkzee" nam de bewolking vrij shel tot tot N=7. Bij het beschijnen van het wateroppervlak d.m.v. de Aldislamp werd een groot aantal hei wit oplcihtende deeltjes geconstateerd, doch van rode deeltjes, zoals deze genoemd worden bij diverse anders waarnemingen van het verschijnsel "melkzee", was in dit geval absoluut geen sprake. Te 18.00 werden enige grote donkere plekken in het water waargenomen en te 18.10 verkreeg de zee snel weer haar normale aanzien. Te 18.20 deed zich hetzelfde verschijnsel voor tot 18.55. Hierna nogmaals van 20.10 tot 22.00 en van 22.15 tot 23.00. Waarnemingen bij het begin van het eerste verschijnsel:  Temp. Natte Bol: 20.00 gradens C. Temp. Droge Bol: 23.8 gradens C. Temp.

The sea instead of being relatively darker than the sky was lighter and was much more noticeably so forward of the beam. We considered that there was some form of very low mist on the water, this theory being borne out by the fact that was wave crests seemed indistinct at any distance from the ship. The mist must have been low since Capa Guardifui light was visible throughout the period to distances reaching 25 miles. At 1915 GMT a black line appeared on the horizon forward of the beam and slowly approached. This was in actual fact, the sea returning to normal. The horizon remained phossy for about half an hour.

Ship's lights and horizon difficult to make out. Aldis lamp had no effect on luminescence though some bright parts of light observed in ship's wake. Sky had previously cleared from being lightly overcast and general appearance of the sea then was a pale white. The ENE force 2-3 wind had died down at 2300 GMT, sea was calm with no appreciable swell. At time of observation the sea temperature was 75 deg air temperature 75 deg, wet bulb 70.5 deg.

The sea took on a strange milky appearance, like a frozen lake; the beam from an Aldis lamp produced a sparkling jewelled effect. Initially there was 3/8th low cloud and when this cleared the sea returned to normal, only to have the effect recur when the cloud reformed. It was a dark night with excellent visibility. Air temperature 73.5 deg, wet bulb 67.3 deg, sea temperature 76.0 deg, wind ENE force 4. The same was seen for a short period the following night when there was no cloud and the horizon was extremely dark. Observed by Mr. G. A. Berry, 2nd Officer and Mr. J. A. Davison Cadet.

The water, as far as the eye could see, was emanating a dull greyish glow. Individual bright yellow particles were visible under the beam of the Aldis lamp. The switching on and off of the radar set had no apparent effect. The vessel was traversing the area for most of the next four hours and thus its approximate extent was in the region of 60 miles or so. A sample of sea water was obtained and surgical spirit added as a preservative in the ratio 3 parts water to 2 parts spirit. In the event of the organisms not surviving, please be informed that upon examining the water after getting it on board, it was found to contain worm-like creatures varying in length between about 1mm and 1/2 cm. They appeared to be moving and had fibrous appendages. The sample will be forwarded at the same time as this logbook.	Letter to Dr. Kay	Somalia/Socotra	Milky Sea	0	N/A	158

The sea from horizon to horizon in all directions took on a phosphorescence glow, not brilliant, but a definite glow similar to the glow of a luminous watch. The moon had just set and the whole sea was several shades lighter than the sky. The phosphorescence in the bow wave was not a great deal different to the overall effect. The phenomenon persisted until 2330 GMT, then the intensity decreased until at 2345 GMT the normal night conditions prevailed. When looking into the sea at the height of the phenomenon, it was almost impossible to focus the eye and a slight feeling of vertigo was experienced. This eeriness could well have convinced the superstitious mariners of long ago that the ship would fall off the edge of the world during the night if navigated far from the shore. Observed by Mr. J.

The sea became calm and the whole surface of the sea turned a greyish colour. It gave the appearance that the ship was steaming through a very low mist about 2 feet high, the horizon could not be distinguished although the mast and lights showed no signs of mist.

When the vessel was between Ras Mujallab Haidi and Ras Kaau large amounts of luminescence were seen, of several different types: (a) The ship's bow wave broke in brilliant emerald-green light, with occasional flashes which were bright enough to light up the ship's superstructure. (b) Little spots of sparkling light which were visible up to 3 miles. (c) The vessel passed through 3 or 4 long lines of luminescence which had the appearance of milk or white oil. In the darkness, at a distance of 2 miles or so, looked alarmingly like lines of breakers. The sea temperature bucket was used to get samples and, when brought back on deck, it and especially the rope were found to be covered with luminescence particles. Examination showed that the light was being emitted from semi-transparent egg-shaped objects about 1/16th inch long. Sea temp 77.3 deg F. Wind light and variable.

Het schip was op weg van Kaapstad naar Abadan, koers 026 gradens toen ten 1900 GMT in positie 250 mijl zuid van Socotra de zee grijswit van kleur werd en heet leek alsof het schip in een mistbank liep. het zicht bleef echter goed want laagstaande sterren bleven helder zichtbaar. Alhoewel de wind met kracht 3 Bft bleef waaien leek de zee geheel af te vlakken en gaf ze het aanzicht van een sneeuwlandschap. het was 1/8 bewolkt, waarbij de bewolking bestond uit waarschijnlijk CL2 wolken aan de kim. De temperatuur van het zeewater bedroeg 25 gradens, droge bol 24,9 en natte bol 21,1. Dit waren dezelfde waarden als bij de waarneming van 1800 GMT. Windrichting 030 en nagenoeg geen deining. De boeggolf was nagenoeg niet meer te onderscheiden van het overige water.  Bij het schijnsel van de Aldislamp op de zee werden rood reflecterende wegspringende deeltjes waargenomen. Het verschijnsel hield op tne 2030 GMT en werd ook later niet meer waargenomen. De rood reflecternde deeltjes bleven echter aanwezig. her verschijnlijk kwam, zij het onder een geringere bewolkingsgraad en ander jaargetijde, geheel overeen met dat genoemd in De Zee van maart 1966-Overdruk K.N.M.I. no 107.

The Aldis lamp was trained frequently on the surface to see if anything could be seen. The sea close to the ship appeared much denser and calmed. The night was moonless and cloudy in patches and at times completely clear with bright stars followed closely by being completely overcast. Those overcast periods would for about half an hour and during this time the transluscence would be dimmed without fading away entirely. The horizon appeared very definite and visibility was a about 10-12 miles. The following impressions which this phenomena gave to ship's officers: a. Moonlight on heavily frosted lawns. b. A glass negative plate, which when held up to light with the negative of a sea scape on a suddy day shows great contrast between sea and sky. c. Bright moonlight shining on water with no shadow as if the sea was covered with microfilm of aluminium paint emitting a vague luminescence.	Letter to Dr. Kay	South China Sea	Milky Sea	0	N/A	159

Vessel entered an area where the sea was a milky grey colour which to some extent lit up the vicinity relative to the blackness of the night. The wind was variable light airs, later becoming north-easterly 10 knots with the sky half clouded. On shining the Aldis light on the sea surface, many bright points of light, similar ot that reflected from cats eyes on a road, were seen in the beam. The luminescence covered a considerable area as the vessel remained in the phenomenon for about 4 hours. For one period of 15 minutes we left the luminous area but on approaching more of it the sudden and clear cut transition between black sea and luminescence sea was distinctly visibly at a distance of at least one mile, very similar in appearance to an approaching fog bank. The most noticeable features of this phenomenon as compared with the more usual brilliant green luminescence encountered were that firstly with the latter, an approaching vessel cannot determine the area of luminescence until the wash disturbs it, with the phenomenon the area was most obvious and secondly passage of the ship through it had no effect on its luminosity. Although whilst in the area almost all the area was affected by the luminescence, there were very occasional isolates strips of dark sea, about 1 ft wide and from 10-100 yards in length.

Risseeuw, werd het volgende rapport van de waarnemining van bogengenoemd verschijnsel ontvangen. "Varende in de Zuidchinese Zee, ongeveer 190 mijl zuid ten westen van Hong Kong, op weg van Singapore naar Hong Kong, werd gedurende de PV en EW van 26 februari 1967 het verschijnsel "melkzee" waargenomen. Te ongeveer 19.10 werd recht vooruit op een aftstand van ca 3 mijl een zware buiige bewolking waargenomen, waaruit het scheen te regenen. De radar werd bijgezet maar er ward van deze zogenaamde bui geen echo ontvangen. De lucht was geheel bedekt met stratusbewolking. Deze stak grauw af t.o.v. de zee. De wolkenbasis lag op ongeveer 300 meter. Te 19.21 werd de zee plotseling egaal wit. Er was zonder kijker geen kim waar te nemen en de bewolking scheen dezelfde kleur te hebben aangenomen als het zeewater. Keek men in de richting tegengesteld aan de koers, dan leek het alsof er een zwarte blinde muur achter het schip hing en voor ons een grote lege ruimte, waarin het schip scheen te zweven. De top- en boordlichten straalden niet uit en van mist was dan ook geen sprake. Bij nader onderzoek van het zeewateroppervlak bleek, dat de witte schuimkoppen van de golven niet of maar een enkele keer zeer dicht bij het schip waren te zien, daar er geen kleurschakering aanwezig was. Er was ook geen boeggolf te zien. Alleen het buiswater dat over dek kwam viel op. Er stond een wind uit NNO-lijke richting, kracht Bft. 5. Daar de schuimkoppen van de golven slecht waren waar te nemen, scheen het alsof de zee was afgeylakt, maar de wind was op het gevoel niet afgenomen. Iedereen die op de brug kwam maakte de opmerking: "het lijkt wel dikke mist of een sneeuwlandshcap, of het vliegen in wolken". Met een kijker (7x50) kon een kim worden waargenomen, daar de bewolking iets donkerder was dan de zee. Er werd zeewater geputst om de zeewatertemperatuur te bepalen en te onderzoeken of men met zeevonken te doen had. Het door water roeren of tegen de puts stoten leverde geen poltseling oplichten op van zeevonken, wat anders vaak een normaal verschijnsel is. Ook werd er met een zaklamp i het water van de puts geschenen, maar dit leverde geen reakties op. Van 21.10 tot 21.15 nam het verschijnsel grotendeels af, maar even later kwam het weer terug, doch in mindere mate als daarvoor; dit duurde tot 22.00. Te 22.00 zag men de grens van de melkzee naderen. Deze weer normale situatie zag men als een zwarte baan op zich afkomen. De positie te 19.21 was 18 deg 44' N en 113 deg 32' O en te 22.00 19 deg 16' N en 113 deg 34' O. Hiertussen was een afstand van 48 mijl afgelegd. De diepte volgens de kaart was tussen 600 en 1000 vadem. Te 20.15 werd een monster van  het zeewater genomen, dat niet werd geconserveerd omdat de methode beschreven in de "Handleiding voor het verrichten van meteorologische waarnemingen op zee" (KNMI-publikatie 118 b) niet mogelijk was bij afwezigheid van het conserveringsmiddel. Waarnemingen te 19.25 verricht: Zeewatertemp: 22.9 deg C. Drogebol 22.8 deg C. Nattebol: 20.2 deg C. Luchtdruk: 1018.8 mb. Windrichting: NNO. Kracht: 5. Matige NNO-lijke deining. Het verschijnsel begon 50 minuten na zonsondergang. het was volle maan, maar deze kon door de bewolking niet worden waargenomen. Of er nog andere schepen zijn geweest die dit verschijnsel hebben waargenomen valt te betwijfelen, daar er op de radar geen andere schepen werden opgemerkt. Bij aankomst te Rotterdam (ongeveer eind april a.s.) zal het monster zeewater u voor verder onderzoek worden toegezonden."	Tim Wyatt, Unpublished Notes/Paper	South China Sea	Milky Sea	0	N/A	159

Krekt, 2nd Officer	Op 9 mei, ongeveer 1 uur na het afzetten van de Shanghai loods, onderweg van Shanghai naar Singapore werd door ons het volgende verschijnsel waargenomen. Te 02.25 uur scheepstijd varende in positie Noord 31 deg 00' Oost 122 deg 35' werd aan de kim een lichte streep waargenomen. Het was geheel bewolkt en de bewolking bestond uit Cl. 6. Het was dus erg donker. Deze witte streep werd steeds breder totdat we in een geheel witte zee voeren. De windsnelheid was ongeveer 20' per uur, dus witte koppen op de golven. Door de grote duisternis en de helderheid van de zee was het een interessant gezicht. Veel opvarenden werden ook uitgepord om dit niet te missen. Het geheel had veel weg van een winter landschap of een bevroren meer bedekt met sneeuw. Door de lichtbundel van een vuurtoren en enkele vuurtjes van visserschepen werd het geheel nog geaccentueerd. Het water uit de koelwater uitlaat gellek een vuurspuwende mond. Door ons werden meteen enekele putsen water opgeslagen. Als je er in ging roeren werd het water zo licht dat je er bij wijze van spreken bij kon lezen. Goot je het water weg, dan waren het allemaal witte celletjes die weg vloeiden. Door de kapitein werd een glas met dit water gevuld. In het licht van de kaartenkamer bleek dat er celletjes in dreven ter grootte van een suiker korrel. Deed je het licht uit en begon je te roeren, dan begon het meteen weer op te lichten. Goot je het water over je handen dan bleven er allemaal lichtpuntjes opzitten. Ookal wreef je er over heen het bleef toch oplichten. Je kon de lichtpuntjes ook laten verspringen. Het bleef dus een hele tijd nalichten. Tot 03.45 uur hebben we zo in deze witte zee gevaren. Soms was het iets minder maar in het algemeen was de zee gewoon wit. De overgang naar een gewone zee ging heel plotseling. Ineens zag ik geen kim meer en aanvankelijk dacht ik dat het mistig werd, maar het bleek dat het fluoriseren opgehouden had. Het was weer net zo'n vreemde gewaarwoding om in deze normale zee te varen als het was om in deze melkzee te varen, Onze positie te 03.45 uur was N. 30 deg 55' N Oost 123 deg 00'.

The vessel entered an area of ocean completely illuminated by phosphorescence. The border of the area was well defined and could be seen on approach at a distance of about 2 miles. The familiar green disks of light were not present and instead the whole area which we judged to be some 5 miles square in extent, glowed, shedding a strong pale green light. In the centre of the affected water, the light given off from the sea was particularly intense, illuminating the base of a low cloud ahead and the entire superstructure of the ship. The sea and swell prevailing locally appeared to be quieter within this area.	Letter to Dr Kay	Christmas Island	Milky Sea	0	N/A	164

On analysing the above data, the sea temperature was found to be well below that of previous observations and the sea temperature isothermal shown on the weather and routing chart for the month of July. Whilst the above information was being logged the watchkeeper called the O.O.W. to the port bridge wing, reporting 'FOG' on the port bow. From about right ahead to 2 points for'd of the beam, at not more than 5 miles, there was a bank of white mist apparently above the water, obliteration of the horizon in that quadrant. In contrast, the horizon on the starboard quarter was sharply defined, the sky black and starlit, the moon not yet having risen, against the sea which was milky white in colour. Previously the wind had been south to southwesterly, force 4/5 producing a moderate to rough sea, but this had considerably subsided to just occasional white horses; those close to the ship appearing very white. 18:35 - Air temp (Dry):24.6 deg C; visbility seeming to be only about 2 miles, but no horizon against which to judge distances or the extent of the height above the water of the phenomena in the for'd quadrant, port side. On the starb'd quarter the whiteness appeared only to extend approximately 1 to 2 feet above the water. The stars above the vessel seemed undimmed. 18:45 - Lowest actually recorded air temperature (dry) -: 24.4 deg C. 19:00 - The vessel 'abeam' of the phenomena, the horizon ahead clearing, the whiteness dispersing. The chart being used showed in excess of 1000 fathoms, the echo sounder when switched on showed no trace. 19:15 - The sea temp taken again -: 25.0 deg C; Air temp (dry) 24.9 deg C. The air at this time was very moist, the bright wing taff rails being beaded with water droplets; it had not been raining. When the Aldis lamp was shone into the air, the light was severely diffused by small water droplets suspended in the air; Potential fog spread out by too high a wind speed?

"Nederland", gezagvoerder de heer A.N.S. Gerus, werd een geval van "melkzee" waargenomen. Het desbtreffende rapport hierover, opgemaakt door de 1e stuurman, de heer N. Veldhuizen, luid als volgt. "Varende in de Timorzee, op weg van Noumea naar Singapore, werd op de H.W. van 14 augustus 1967 het verschijnsel "melkzee" waargenomen. Te 16.45 MTG werd vrij snel de gehele horizon één witte oppervlakte, waarop het schuim van onze boeggolf niet meer zichtbaar was. Het gegist bestek bij aanvang was: 08 deg 45' Z en 128 deg 43' O. Koers 294 deg, vaars 13 mijl per uur. Temperatuur drogebol: 25 deg C. Temperatuur nattebol: 21.2 deg C. Barometer: 1012.5 mbar. Bewolking: nil. Wind: oost, 3 Bft. Temp. zeewater: 25.6 deg C. S.G. zeewater: 1024. Het S.G. werd bepaald met een salinometer, die geijkt is voor 15 deg C. Het S.G. werd niet hiervoor gecorrigeerd. De zee bleef in deze toestand tot 17.55 MTG en werd daarna geleidelijk minder wit; te 18.13 was het verschijnsel geheel verdwenen. Het gegist bestek was toen 08 deg 48' Z en 129 deg 28' O. Temperatuur drogebol: 25 deg C. Temperatuur nattebol: 21.5 deg C. Barometer: 1012.5 mbar. Bewolking: nil. Wind: oost, 2 tot 3 Bft. Temp. zeewater: 25.5 deg C. S.G. zeewater: 1024. Op de D.W. werd te 19.30 MTG in gegist bestek 08 deg 39' Z en 128 deg 00' de zee water lichter aan b.b.-zijde, daarna kwam van de kim aan s.b.-zijde ook een lichte vlek aan. Gedurende de volgende tien minuten voer het schip in een smalle donkere baan van ongeveer een 0,5 mijl breed. Het verschijnsel verdween geleidelijk en was te 19.45 MTG weer geheel verdwenen; gegist bestek: 08 deg 38'Z en 128 deg 07' O. Te 19.55 MTG werd de zee weer licht en werden de volgende waarnemingen gedaan. Temperatuur drogebol: 25 deg C. Temperatuur nattebol: 21.3 deg C. Barometer: 1012.5 mbar. Bewolking: nil. Gegist bestek: 08 deg 37' Z en 128 deg 05' O. Wind: otn, 2 Bft. Temp. Zeewater: 25.8 deg C. S.G. zeewater: 1024. Het verschijnsel hield aan en kon worden waargenomen tot daglicht; het was te 21.05 MTG niet meer waar te nemen. De waarnemingen werden verricht door de 1e stuurman, de 2e sturrmanen de stuurmansleerling." Kapitein Gerus deelde in een latere brief over deze waarneming nog het volgende mede. "Het is een zeer bijzondere gewaarwording in zulk een melkzee te varen; het greef de indruk alsof het schip zich op een sneeuwvlakte voortbeweegt. Bij flink roeren in het opgeslagen zeewater bleken opvallend weinig fosfordeeltjes annwezig te zijn."	Tim Wyatt, Unpublished Notes/Paper	Timor Sea	Milky Sea	0	N/A	169

Wind SE force 4, sea temperature 59. For approximately 30 minutes the whole sea surface in the area surrounding the vessel ie as far as the eye could sea was lit up by phosphorescence to a remarkable and impressive degree. It was a perfect example of the white water or milky sea described in the Marine Observer's Handbook accentuated by the moderate to rough following sea whose waves glowed and illuminating white and very bright as they broke on the surface. Various shades of blue and green were the predominent colours in the water, very difficult to describe in words but not unlike the green of the still waters penetrating into the depth of the Mediterranean sea in summer.

12/23/1967	20:15 GMT	12/23/1967	(?)	02 deg 47' N	10 deg 38' W	SS Onoba	M. Klein, Third Officer	Op 23 december 1967 werd in positie 02-47N en 010-38W om 20.15 GMT een viftiental helder lichtende strepen aan beide zijden van het schip in het water waargenomen, die aan bakboord in een richting van 020 gradens - 200 gradens en aan stuurboord ongeveer oost - west liepen. De strepen aan bb. waren helderder dan aan sb. Gestuurd werd 320 r.w. Ze liepen dus ongeveer evenwijdig met de boeggolf. Ze waren ongeveer 300 meter lang, 10 meter breed en met een tussenruimte van ongeveer 30 meter, en begonnen ongeveer op een streek aan bb. en aan sb. Scheen men met een schijnwerper op het water, dan lichttten de zich daaren bevindende deeltjes een ogenblik later even op, terwijl er met behulp van een lamp ook zeer vele sigaarvormige lichamen geien werden, die helemaal niet oplichten en die daarom ten opzichte van het water witachtig leken. Alleen naast en achter het schip lichtten ze op. Het gehele verschijnsel duurde ongeveer een minuut. Geruime tijd daarvoor reeds werden naast en achter het schip dezelfde lcihtgevende sigaarvormige deeltjes waargenomen, die voldeden aan de beschrijving ervan in het uittreksel van "de Zee", nr. 2 van juni 1957. Tien minuted later werd voor het schip over een zeer grote uitgestrektheid een hele melkwitte zee waargenomen, waar we enige ogenblikken later doorheenvoeren en waaren dezelfde lichtgevende deeltjes voorkwamen, doch hoogstwaarschijnlijk ook kleinere. Het gebied was ongeveer 1 mijl breed en 5 mijl lang. hier hebben we zeewater obgeslagen, maar slaagden met onze daarvoor minder geschikte middelen er niet in een van deze langwerpige deeltjes te vangen. Tussen de beide verschijnselen in werden aan beide zijden van het schip zover men met behukp van een lamp kon zien over de gehel zee deze sigaarvormige deeltjes waargenomen, die echter niet oplichtten, als men er op scheen, doch alleen naast en achter het schip oplichtten. Tot +/- 21.15 GMT werden daarna nog dezlfde lichtende deeltjes naast ena chter het schip gezien, waarna ze geleidelijk uit het gezicht verdwenen. De bewolking was een egale stratus-laag, terwijl er nauwelijks wind, zeegang en deining waren. De positie van het schip was in het gebied, dat in Admiralty Chat no. 594 staat aangegeven als "Average Boundary between the Guinsea and Equatorial Currents" Zeewater temperatur 26,5 gradens Droge bol tomp. 26,4 gradens, Natte bol 23,8 gradens Dauepunt 22 gradens Relatieve vochtigheid 80% Barometer 1013,5	Tim Wyatt, Unpublished Notes/Paper	West Africa	(?)	1	N/A	172

Considerable amount of phosphorescnece observed. The entire sea was affected from forward of the ship to the horizon. Initially appeared as a low fog bank looming up ahead but finally when the ship was surrounded, the normal night time glowing of the sea and sky reversed i.e. the sea appeared as a clear (no cloud sky) milky white in colour and the sky black as on a moonless night. Whole effect very similar to that of heavy ice (light etc) duration approximately 30 minutes followed by normal conditions with possibility of improved visibility.

At 0001 the sea around the ship's course and extending for at least 3 or 4 miles was observed to have a thick milky appearance and although a dark night, upon close examination with the air of an Aldis lamp, the possibility of cause by a film of oil was eliminated. Soundings by electronic device revealed no trace. The sea bottom at the time of observation was approximately 900 fathoms. (Mr. A. Lim, 2nd Officer and B. Lee, 3rd Officer).

Within a period of 5 minutes at 1610 GMT (2010 at ship) the sea took on a very pronounced milky colour and appeared to glow. At times it was quite impossible to make any horizon except when sky appeared darker than sea. Shining of the Aldis lamp on the surface of the sea failed to increase luminescence. These milky seas cleared at 1720 GMT but returned again at about 1830 until 2030. This effect did not seem to affect the visibility.	Letter to Dr. Kay	Somalia/Socotra	Milky Sea	0	N/A	175

The weather was overcast at the time of observation with continuous light rain when the horizon started to lighten, giving the appearance of the cloud base lifting. However as time proceeded it was apparent that this was not the case and that the light was in face a vast covering of what appeared to be a semi-fluorescent substance on the sea surface. After the initial patch, several more lage streaks of the same phenomenon were observed and at the same time a distinct musty smell was noticed which passed with the eventual dissipation of the surface patches (Messrs I.

Whilst reporting the weather for 1800 GMT the sea and swell, which had been running astern of us for most of the voyage, appeared to die down and up ahead the horizon, or what appeared to be the horizon, became most distinct. Then followed the strange phenomenon known as 'luminosity of the sea' of which a good description is to be found in the West Cost of India Pilot (No. 38). The very distinct horizon was emphasized by a white wall of mist, not very high. The foremast light showed no loom so it could hot have reached a height of more than 20 ft. The sea became very milky and the bow wave became very indistinct until the sea appeared as a carpet of white with no definition between the ship's wake and the sea. The luminosity developed until it was very bright and almost took on the appearance of a thick carpet of snow, with almost enough light to read a book by on the wing of the bridge. The first spasm of this phenomenon lasted for almost an hour when it looked as though it would die away, then shortly afterwards it recurred and did not finally die away until 2200.

De kim was vrij zwak te onderscheiden en soms dacht men met een opkomende mist te maken te hebben. Toch bleek dit niet het geval tezijn, daar het voortoplicht, alsmede het groen boordlicht niet straalden zoals gebruikelijk is bij mist, of sterk verminderd zicht. Te 2300 boordtijd=2000 MTG verdween de nog aanwezige kim vrij plotseling, en werd de zeevoor ongeveer 5/8 wit. Het leek alsof men te doen had met een ijsveld waar doorheengevaren werd. De boeggolf die normaal sterk fluoriseert, was nu echter asgrauw geworden. Na een minuut of 5 begon de kim weer flauw in zicht te komen. Het verschijnsel was goed waartenemen van recht vooruit tot ongeveer 2 streken achterlijker dan dwars zowel aan bakboord en stuurboord. De rest van de zee vertoonde echter een normale aanblik.

A few minutes later the sea turned milky white as far as the horizon in all directions it was so pale that the ship's wake appeared darker. At about the same time the sea, which had been very heavy, moderated slightly and did not appear to break so much. The sky prior to the phenomenon was completely covered with a semi-transparent autostratus cloud but this cleared rapidly and by 2015 was clear. Visibility was about 6-7 miles (radar range of another vessel). Darker patches of sea were observed lying in a north-easterly direction but in the immediate vicinity of the ship the sea remained white and appeared to increase in intensity. The vessel remained in these conditions until dawn when it was no longer possible to see the luminescence.	Letter to Dr Kay	Somalia/Socotra	Milky Sea	0	N/A	181

At 2320 SMT, on a moonless night during the SW monsoon, the whole sea surface took on a milky appearance, an effect which was found to disappear around the vessel when the deck floodlights were switched on. The phenomenon lasted until first light; throughout that time the white horses were still visible and had a slightly phosphorescent appearance. Nobody on board had ever seen anything like this before, not even the Captain in all his years at sea. As this seemed to be such a rare thing I thought you might be interested to hear about it and have some idea as to what it was, though there was some speculation by my wife that it was to do with plankton and marine life under the sea.

At 2320 the vessel entered an area in which the sea appeared to be lit by subdued under-sea lighting, causing it to glow an opaque grey-green colour. The wind was SSW, force 4 at the time, causing the sea to break, apart from which the surface appeared rather dead as if covered by ice-rind. The lighted areas stretched from horizon to horizon without any discontinuity. Normal bright speckles of marine bioluminescence continued to appear in the water disturbed by the ship's movement. Prior to arriving in the area, an indication of its existence was given by a haze over the horizon like an aurora. This became gradually brighter as we reached the area, the water changing from a glowing silver-green colour to grey-green as we entered. There was at the time a noticeable salty smell in the air.

Observed 11-12 January 1976. Approximate positon 6 deg N 52 deg E. As the vessel approached the area of "milky sea" the brightness increased dramatically. When the vessel entered the "milky sea" at 2342 its extent was observed to be from horizon to horizon and when the vessel was about halfway across no clear water was visible at all, the "milky sea" still extended around the horizon. The colour of the sea can best be described as "pale banana" (i.e. the colour of the fruit and not that of the outer skin). No individual luminous organisms were osberved, and the shining of the Aldis lamp on the surface, the turning on and off the radar, and echo sounder had no effect on the brightness of the luminescence, which had by this time come bright enough to make the stars distinguishable only with the greatest difficulty, and to make it quite easy to read without the aid of artificial light. At 0005 a water sample was obtained and treated with formalin, but the time elapsed before handing over the sample for analysis and the fact that no information regarding the amount of formalin to be used was available, may have caused the sample to deteriorate somewhat. (Information regarding the use and proportions of the various preservatives available would be most welcome.) At 0037 the vessel crossed the northern edge of the "milky sea" and it was observed that the edge was clearly defined and did not fade gradually as it was approached. This was also seen to be the case upon the vessel entering the patch. as the vessel proceeded away from the patch it was again observed that the clouds were luminated by the water.

Between 1700 and 2100 GMT, a "white water" phenomena oberved, where the sea all around the ship, stretching to the horizon, was illuminated by a 'milky' greenish/white light. This "blanket" of light appeared to be a few feet above the actual sea surface and seemed to have a calming effect on the surface of the water, although the wind speed and direction did not alter considerably. This "blanket" of light was unbroken and nowhere in it was observed any individual patches of bright green bioluminescence normally associated with the phenomena of "phosphorescence". The effect of this phenomena was totally negated by the rising of the moon shortly after 2100 G.M.T. Air temp. 25.0 deg C, wet bulb 24.0 deg C, sea temp 27.0 deg C, wind EXN force 4, sea slight.

Below are listed the meteorological conditions present when once again an extensive area of bioluminescence was observed. It took the form of the "Milky Sea" described in the Mariner's Handbook and was more prominent than the one reported to you by us of the 6th January 1976. If a description is desired it appeared to be like an ice rink and lasted some considerably time. The sky was a sharp contrast to the whiteness of the sea. Vessel entered area of bioluminescence in 4 deg 13'N 51 deg 27'E. Left 5 deg 14'N 52 deg 10'E, Sea Temp 79 deg F, air temp 78 deg F, Cloud 3/8 cover, Wind NNE force 3, Course 025 (T), Speed 13 knots. A sample of the sea water was obtained and is being forwarded to the department we hope that the information will be of some help to you and look forward to hearing of any progress being made in the pursuit of understanding this phenomenon.

The moon had not yet risen and the sky was covered by a thin layer of cirrostratus. Wind SSW 6, moderate swell, air temp 25 deg C, sea temp 23.6C. All signs of the rough sea were hidden from sight as the rough glow from the bioluminescence made the surface look white and flat to the observer. The only effect apparent when the Aldis light was aimed at the was to shine through the glow and expose the rough sea. It was noted that the sea temperature had dropped 2 1/2 deg C near the time of this observation and that it did not rise again until after all signs of bioluminescence had disappeared at 1800 GMT.

The horizon ahead was completely obscured and it appeared as if the sea was lighting up the sky, the ships radar was switched on, as precaution, as nothing visible. Ahead although vis around was in excess of 6mls it was also noted that the air became very dry. One could feel this when taking a deep breath, one of the ship's engineers commented that he found it quite hard to breath.

During this period we observed an example of total bioluminescence covering the sea up to the visible horizon, which provided a hazy dividing line between the white sea and the clear dark sky. The sea was a milky white in colour and could therefore be described as "milky sea" bioluminescence. It was observed, using an aldis lamp,  that the air directly above the sea contained a fine mist. We took a water sample and obtained a temperature the water was colourless and showed no visible signs of life forms.

There was one other ship in our area that was G.D.R. vessel "Frieden" on a WSW course bound for Port Kelang from Antwerp via Suez Canal. We sighted her at 1830 and she first encountered the milky sea @ 1630. Throughout this period of time only a trace of cirrus cloud was to be seen in the sky.

At the time the whole atmosphere, sea, sky turned completely milky white in colour such that the horizon was indistinguishable and D.O. stars visible. Prior to this there had been traces of cumulus cloud [3/8 cl1] with good visibility after passing rain showers at 1500 GMT. This complete whiteness lasted [approx?] 70 minutes, and then the sky became visible with a distinct horizon. But the sea remained white as though illuminated from below in all directions. No apparent sudden change in atmospheric pressure or temp. were observed as the following table shows and the sea remained this white colour until day break on the 29th 0220 G.M.T. At 1630 GMT the wind appeared to have dropped dead right from SE'lt (F4) to calm and the sea surface appeared to be very glassy, with the bow wave hardly breaking. ON the whole our first impressions were that a sea mist or a  low level sea smoke had occurred but the use of the 'Aldia lamp' dispelled this theory. When the 'Aldis' ws shone on the water, small brilliant 'red lights' were observed in the ships bow wave, whilst the phosphorescent was restricted to a dull turquioise glow in a band about 18 (inches) wide along the ships side. No phosphorescent flashes were observed. These condiition continued throughout the night. The radar was also used but nothing unusual was observed. While the hoirzon and sky became visible stars were observed down to about 5 deg altitude and a check on many of the brighter ones failed to reveal any svintillation. A sea water sample was taken at 1715 GMT and this appeared clear. 1745 GMT dense patchs of cirius [2/8 CH2] were observed developing in a S'ly direction, then being stationary nad dissolving with about half an hour. Occasional wind waves were beggining to break from a SSE direction (Force 3). Too dark to observe swell waves but if any then slight. 1900 G.M.T. dark narrow patches were seen stretching across the wake from about 2-3 minutes while vessel crossed it clear. More similar patches seen occasionally thereafter. 2000 GMT a sample of sea water was taken while vessel crossed these dark patches, and tiny white particles could be seen settled at the bottom of the container. 2100 GMT horizon could be observed more sharply but condition of sea - same. 2330-2030 GMT Wind dropped to a dead calm, the sky cleared up completely, and the horizon became clear cut and distinct. Gentle breeze from SSE at 0030 GMT and clouds developing carrying rain with them. Vessel experienced fine drizzle from 0050 to 0058 GMT - wind gradually increased to force 3.

For a period of 2 hrs 10 mins from 1930 to 2140 GMT the vessel passed through a "MILKY SEA" which gave off a strong and constant greyish glow as far as the eye could see. Visibility at the time was about 10 miles. The wind was SSW 7 though during the period the vessel passed through the "Milky Sea" the sea was calm with only the swell persisting. The following observations were made at the time - Barometer 1006, Air temp 25 C, Sea Temp 25 C, Relative Humidity 84%, Dew Point 22.

On closer inspection it was found to be in the water stretching across the bows of the ship for a distance of approximately 100 yards. The light was of a "milky white" nature and was approximately 15 feet in width. On passing through "the band of light", the wash from the vessel erupted into a brilliant green colour illuminating the whole superstructure aboard, this lasted for about 10 minutes.

Radar in use both before, during and after occurrence,  an Aldis lamp projected on to the sea surface excited no further luminescence, but did reveal fairly numerous, although scattered, orange coloured 'cats eyes' these stopped shning as soon as the lamp was switched off or directed away from them and appeared to hae a motion independent of water movement. Possibly reflection from surface feeding fish? Bow wave luminescence continued until 3 hours after observation.	Letter to Dr. Herring	Somalia/Socotra	Milky Sea	0	N/A	205

O'neill	On the morning of 25th August 1977 at 0220 hrs L.T. (241820Z) it was observed that there was a glow around the vessel similar to that mentioned in the marine observers handbook page 112 last sentence. At 0250 a bright line of light was seen ahead of the vessel on a line with the horizon, as the vessel moved towards this line the horizon disappeared and the vessel seemed to be climbing. It was also observed that from the line of light right to the horizon the sea was glwoing with a "ghostly" green/white light. There was a definite edge to this phenomenon which passed the vessel at 0355 and by 0410 the whole was was glowing for 360 deg and from the ship to the horizon. This lasted until morning twilight. Even though the anemometer gave readings of 2-5 the sea surface was smooth. No sea temp. this vessel being U.M.S. and has no means of taking temp from bridge. General Weather 3/8 1/8 C_L 1. Cumulus with little vertical extent. good visibility. P.S. The only thing we can think of that could have caused this phenomenon was the earthquake on the 22nd August near the Lombok Strait.

The shining of an Aldis Lamp and the turning on/off of the radar again had no effect on the brightness of the water. A water sample was obtained. As the water was poured into the bottle bright 'spots' were observed in the water. They lasted for a few seconds before fading away. The temperature of this sample was 25.2 deg C. It was decided to try a different method of preserving this sample. The sample was treated with four drops of "A meroid G.C." which is described by the suppliers as "a strong, reduced alkaline." After about one hour the bottom fifth of the bottle was cloudy. Weather at time of observation Wind SW force 5. Moderate/rough sea. Good visibility Air temp 25.6 deg C, wet bulb 24.2 deg C, sea temp 25.2 deg C. 1830Z 5/9/77 Sea was very bright sea temp 25.0 deg C. Dark 'patches' observed in water around V/L. These 'patches' appeared to be moving around vessel. As the vessel approached one of these patches it split into two sections and moved away from the bow. I think that this "patchy" effect was  having been caused by schools of fish being silhouetted against the sea surface by a light from below. Perhaps the light that causes this white water phenomena is 'generated' from some depth below the sea surface. 2000Z Moonrise sea slightly less bright, sea temperature was 24.9 deg C the sky is lightly clouded below 20 deg although moon not visible yet. 2030Z 5/9/77 1/2 hours fter moonrise, moon is now visible at about 15 deg altitude sea gradually fades and resumes normal appearance.

A phenomenon closely resembling the milky sea or white water, which is occasionally described in The Marine Observer, was observed throughout the hours of darkness. A horizon appeared for part of the time as a clear cut zone of blackness over the white, but at other times visibility was much reduced by the glow. The appearance of the sea was of an indistinct hazy white glow. Throughout the radar was in operation. No reaction to the Aldis lamp was observed.

At 1830 GMT an area of bioluminescence, which had the appearance of white sea fog, was observed to the west of the vessel. About 20 minutes later, when the vessel entered the affected area, a diffuse milky light effect was observed just above the sea surface. The sea was clearly visible but the white horses noteably reduced in brightness. No effect was observed on the bioluminescence when the Aldis lamp was switched on. At its brightest the phenomenon was sufficent to illuminate the clouds. There was no moon that night, the luminous effect was, therefore, due entirely to the phenomenon. The bioluminescence began to reduce in intensity at about 2100 and was no longer observed about half an hour later. A sample of sea-water was taken and was observed to be clear and normal. It was also noted that the water showed no response when exposed to a fluorescent ultra-violet light. Position of ship: 06 deg 16'N, 52 deg 43'E.	Mar.

Waargenomen: De zee was spierwit, terwijl de hemel zich hier zwart tegen aftekende. Schuimplekken op het water tekenden zich af als zwarte vlekken. Dezelfde lucht die kenmerkend is voor die an opwellend dieptewater, was ook hier te ruiken. Sterren, die op een hoogte van 10 gradens en hoger stonden, bleven goed zichtbaar. Hoewel er een ZW-lijke deining liep met een golfhoogte van 4 á 5 meter en een ZZW-lijke zeegang van 3 á 4 meter hoogte, waren deze in de witte zee niet te zien. Toen we ons nog buiten de melkzee bevonden, leek het eerst als het schijnsel van de lichten van een grote stad die nog achter de kim ligt; dichterbij komend kreeg het het aanzien van een mistbank. Af en toe was +/- 1/3 van de zee spierwit, terwijl het andere gedeelte een vaal witte kleur had, maar dat varieerde erg sterk. Ondanks het feit dat het mistig leek en er geen kim te zien was, bleek een schip op 10 mijl afstand toch goed zichtbaar. De luchtdruk steeg beide keren dat de oplichting het felst was (ZIE bijgevoegde barograafstrook). De wind nam af tot +/- 16 mijl/uur, terwijl deze weer toenam na 22.00 GMT tot +/- 30 mijl/uur. Rond 21.50 GMT, de verkleuring het felst en de kim zeer scherp, waren hoogte observaties van sterren goed mogelijk. Na 22.10 GMT vervaagde alles erg snel en na 5 minuted had alles z'n normale kleur weer. De deining en zeegang werden weer zichtbaar ende wind nam toe toe 7 Bft. Naast het schip zag het water er inderdaad uit als melk. Verder gaf het geheel dezelfde indruk als een negatief van een zwart/wit foto. Vanwege de hoge snelheid van het schip was het niet mogelijk om een watermonster te nemen. 	Tim Wyatt, Unpublished Notes/Paper	Somalia	Milky Sea	0	N/A	209

The vessel entered into a north/south line of bright milky water, about 5 minutes later we were completely surrounded and the surface seems to be glowing all round the horizon. The bow waves did not have any affect or changes in the characteristics of the degree of brightness neither did the Aldis lamp. Stars were visible from approximately 10 deg above the horizon, separated from the sea by a layer of dark atmosphere, which makes us feel as if we were floating on the bright surface. 18 minutes later: this phenomenal effect disppeared as we steamed out of the lighted north/south boundary.

Speed 15 1/2 knots, weather: wind SW5, M~R seas, no cloud cover, haze with visibility approximately 7'. moonless night with no stars visible below an altitude of 25 deg. Between 2030 and 2100 there was a gradual change in the differential colouration of the sea and sky from the normal dark night IE sea+horizon darker than the sky, the two gradually merged, and then the sea took on the paler hue and in constrast the sky was black. The colour of the sea was similar to the colour of the sea seen on a moonlit night when lightly overcast. Brighter stars were visible throughout the sea reverted back to normal gradually. 2140~2150Z the same occurred but more rapidly however when the white water disappeared the horizon to the north and west of the ship was considerably brighter than that to the east. By 2155Z the brightening of the horizon was similar in appearance to the sighting of a fog bank in daylight, with the same intense "whiteness" to it. By 2200 the white water had returned, but its intensity this third time was far greater than the previous two experienced. By 2205 it had again disappeared. On the last occasion, which was a sudden transformation, the leading edge of the white water ran approximately in the direction of 030 deg/210 deg, and must have been approximately 1.3 miles wide (based on time running through it), and extending horizon to horizon, therefore 10~14 miles long.

The luminescence was most pronounced close to the vessel and in it's wake. The strength of the "glow" at first gave the impression of fog but the visibility was determined from sightings of other vessels to be in excess of ten nautical miles.

The sea became milky from the ship to the horizon and all around the horizon the light being emitted was quite intense and made the sea appear featureless. It was unaffected by the shining of lights onto the sea surface. The night was clear with no moon and only about 1 ohla[?] of small cumulus cloud. The phenomenon persisted until 2035 GMT when it began disappearing and at 2045 GMT it had completely gone. During this interval the ship steamed a distance of 79 nautical miles.

US Navy; Reid Hinson US Navy	Totlton: (At) about 1930-2030 hrs, Reid Hinson announced that something unusual out on the seas. Much of the crew went out on deck and we were amazed at what we saw. It was night already and dark. It was like we were in the "Twilight Zone" and peering at a negative of the real world. The seas were glowing with phosphorescence as far as you could see all around us. The ship was darker than the seas, the sky was darker than the seas (normally the seas are the darkest of all). The phosphorescence was uniform and a bit lighter green or "whiter" than the normal screw-generated green phosphorescence ( kind of like the glow-in-the-dark plastic stars you can buy your kids). There were no breaks in the phosphorescence even with the waves, i.e., I didn't see any "holes" of dark water but the wave foam was dark against the glowing water. I don't know how deep it went, but it appeared to be deeper than just the surface water - more than several yards deep. Hinson: My impression at that time was that there was a very low level of fog, the top of which was about 10 ft above the water. The fog, coupled with fairly intense bioluminescence, looked like an illuminated blankted that was quite remarkable, almost surreal.	Miller et al. 2021	Socotra	Milky Sea	0	N/A	221

While steaming on a course of 105 deg (T) and 23 knots a white glow on the horizon of a cloudless sky was observed, this was deemed to be unknown. On approaching further it appeared to be a white line extending across the horizon from port to starbaord. On crossing into this area the whole sea appeared to be a "milky sea" giving a constant white glow with patches of luminous masses. The sea was so bright that the ship's silhouette appeared vividly against its luminous background. This was believed to be bioluminescence and was observed for approx 5 miles.

It was not particularly bright but appeared to glow with a luminosity similar to a light being shone on the sea. It was a clear moonless night and this produced an almost supernatural effect, the sea being a few shades brighter than the sky,  as though the vessel were sailing on a silver sea of light. A sample of sea water taken for a sea water temperature, with the rubber bucket, revealed small specks of light about the size of a pinhead when emptied into a tray. When a torch was shown into the tray nothing could be seen, it was only in the dark that the[y] made themselves known. Larger blobs of light could be seen in the vessels wake at frequent intervals. Only once did the bioluminescence diminish for a period of about ten minutes aroound 1820-1830Z but it soon returned eventually disappearing as quickly as it had arrived at 1915Z.

DeVanney, Chief Officer	Once again, I have been fortunate enough to experience the sight of the very remakrable, natural phenomena of the "Milky Sea". This time, after a gap of a little over seven years, and once again in the Arabian sea on two consecutive nights. I am serving as Chief Officer on the 318,000 tonne Shell tanker 'LIMA' which is presently bound on a laden passage from Mina-al-Fahal, in Oman, to Lyme Bay, England. Unlike my previous three sightings of the bioluminescence which appeared shortly after evening twilight, these sightings were not apparent until the Middle Watch. We had left our loading port of Fahal on 27th July and were now proceeding into the heavy seas of the South West Monsoon, steering a course of 209 deg (T) at a speed of 5.2 knots. At 2036Z 31st July, (0036 S.T. 1st August) the sea suddenly turned a "Milky White" giving the effect that we were steaming through a snow covered ploughed field and causing mixed reactions among those on the bridge. Second officer G.J. 'Borus' Lea was the initial observer and, was a little dubious as to what he was seeing. Having only rarely visited the Arabian Gulf area he had not seen the like before. Other observers of the phenomena were: Deck Cadet N.T. Dobson, Chinese G1 seaman Heung Chi Ming of the middle watch, Chinese GL seaman Wong Chu and, Chief Officer A.F.DeVanney of the 4-8 watch. It was also the first sighting for both Cadets and, so far as I could ascertain, of the Chinese Watchkeepers. The effect continued through until morning twilight at approximately 0100Z 1st. Agu. the effect was nowhere near as bright as I had seen it on previous occasions and, possibly due to my having 'seen it before' was not as eerie though was just as fascinating and exciting as in the past. Our position at the time of initially sighting the phenomena as fixed by Magnavox MX1112 Satellite Navigator was 14 deg 55.2'N 57 deg 44.8'E, wind from s.s.w. force 8 (Beaufort Scale) sea state 5, swell 8 (Douglas Scale) with visibility in excess of 12 miles. The sky was clear, barometer 1013m.b. uncorrected ona. Kelvin hughes aneroid type, height of eye 29 metres. Air temperature 26 deg C, sea temperature 26 deg C and, as previously stated, course 209 deg (T) speed 5.2 knots. Satellite position at twilgith, 0100Z, 14 deg 30.2'N 57 deg 34.2'E with the weather conditions similar throughout apart from a rise in barometric pressure of nearly 1m.b. A sea sample was taken and is forwarded separately to your good selves. The usual scepticism was apparent as to what was the cause till the various publications on the subject had been consulted. Most of the observers had seen the phosphorescent trail in the ship's wake and from the bow wave but, this was a new and wonderful experience. I wondered if it was possible that it could appear the following night as I had previously experienced whilst serving as the Second Officer in the s.s. Mengelia back in 1974 but, knowing this to be quite unusual, thought the liklihood of this to be too rara avis. Imagine, then, my delight and surprise upon taking over the watch to find we were indeed, steaming through that snow covered ploughed field! This time the phenomena became visible at 2036Z 1st. Aug 0045 S.T. 2nd. Aug. Satellite position 13 deg 04.3'N 56 deg 44.3'E again steering 209 deg (T) speed 5.35 knots. The effect was apparent till twilgiht ethced its way into the night at approximately 0110Z. Only the cadets were non-observers this time, Sunday being their day of rest! wind was still steady from the S.S.W. force 8 (Beaufort) sea 6 swell 7 (Douglas) visibility around 12 miles and a cloudless sky. Our trusty aneroid read 1013m.b.-uncorrected- rising to 1014.5 m.b. uncorrected, by twilight, air and sea temperatures were both 25 deg C. 0500 satellite pos'n 12 deg 44.3'N 56 deg 32.8'E. The intensity was similar to the previous evenings sighting. Unfortunatley, the Mariners Handbook was 'on loan' from the library so it was until after the sightings that I came across the last paragraph in chapter 6:9 on bioluminescence and hence, obtain two samples. I am sure that both the M.O.D. and yourselves are in regular contact about such matters so one sample, hopefully, will serve you both. My apologies for this faux pas on my behalf. I have sent a copy of this report to the M.O.D. Taunton. Hoping the above is of some assistance to you. Yours faithfully, A.F. Devanney. Chief Officer S.S.

Sax, Captain	31st July 1981 0025 GMT (30-7-81 2025 Local Chilean Time) Lat 20 deg 56'N Long 70 deg 26'W - Coast of Chile Course 188 deg (T). Vessel on passage from Iquique to Antoragasta (speed 16 knots). Very strong bioluminescence of a very light green colour, being slightly irritating to the eyes, further away from the vessel the sea had the appearance of being rough as if white horses caused by a force 6 wind, when in fact the wind was no more thann force 4 from the S.W. On the horizon to the S.W. there was a light band similar to what may be seen on a cloudy sky during the period of very early dawn. This phenomena proved to be an optical illusion as within minutes the sea could be seen to be covered in what appeared to be a very low lying illuminated haze, but again this was proved to be an illusion, and in fact, as the vessel passed the area, estimated to be about 1/4 mile on the starboard beam, it could be seen that it was in fact the sea which was glowing with a very  pale, milky dim light. This phenomena disappeared within a few minutes. The glowing white horses rough sea effect faded in about 12 minutes, the very bright bow wave began to fade at the same time but remained just visible for a further 15 to 20 minutes. Weather information at the time of observation: sky cloudy 5, wind S.W. 3, slight sea, long low swell, (SW'LY) Baro. 1013.6, Air Temp 14.8, wet bulb 12.9, sea temp 15.9. It may be of interest and have some connection with the above observation that when the vessel arrived at the Iquique anchorage on the morning of the 30th at 0245 (L.M.T.) A ground swell was experienced, at 0700 when the vessel entered port, some difficulty was experienced in securing to the berth, throughout the day the swell increased causing this cessel and the M/V "Blue Master' to part moorings. When the pilot boarded at 1600 to take the 'Oropesa' out of the port, I asked him about the swell, he told me the previous day there was no problem but today the swell was getting strong and that the usual pattern of events was that the swell would most likely increase until tomorrow (31st) when it would be its trongest, then would start to calm down by the latter part of the 31st. And the 1st August, and by the morning of the 4th day would be quiet again. In other words a 3 day period, He also said that these heavy 3 day swells occurred about 4 or 5 times a year.

08/01/1981	21:30 LOC	08/02/1981	01:20 LOC	13 deg 25' N	56 deg 35' E	SS Mena	J.Y. Simpson, Third Officer; P.F. Redfern, Master	Dear Sir, I wish to submit a report on the sighting of "white water". At the time in question the above vessel was on passage from Mina al Falh to Mombasa. On the evening of the 1st August 1981 whilst on a course of 204 True with a speed of 11 knots in position 1352 North 5635 East the following phenomenon occurred. The weather at the time was SSW 8, barometer 1000 steady, Air temp 25C and sea temp 28 1/2 C. At 2130 Local time the visibility having been 6 miles suddenly lifted to 10 miles and the horizon became sharp where previously it had been hazy due to heavy seas and spray. A band of "White Water" was observed on the port side and was increasing in size. By 2145 hours the creamy white area was now across the path of the vessel and spreading all round the horizon. Estimation of the size of the area would be about 6 miles in diameter coming from an ESE direction. At 2230 hours and the vessel was still in the center of the area of "White Water" and both sea and sky were still intensely illuminated. The effect was that of sailing on top of a cloud. Where the bow wave actually broke the water took on its normal colour but returned to its luminous appearance the moment the water settled. Lights were shone on the surface and the white milky effect disappeared but when the lights were switched off the luminous effect reappeared instantly. 2330 hours and still there was no sign of this effect disappearing although some patches about 3 miles from the vessel appeared more greyish in colour. The sky remained clear and no fluctuation occurred in the air or sea temperatrues, barometer steady, no trace on the Echo Sounder and no magnetic anomaly noted. Although the wind remained force 8 the wave tops had disappeared almost as if a light film of oil had been spread over the surface. 2350 hours and the area ahead looked as if it was returning to its normal state although a large white loom showed across the horizon ahead. Midnight and the normal sea state for force 8 had lasted 10 minutes then once again the vessel was in the midst of this milky white sea. The area was again as large as previously and with the same intense illumination effect. 0045 hours and the sea was now turning from creamy white to a more greyish colour although the size of the area still remained as far as the eye could see all round the horizon. 0110 hours and the effect had thinned out with the sea surface returning to normal for a force 8 gale. By 0120 hours there was no trace of 'White Water" in any direction, it was just as if it had never been. I hope the aforegoing information can be of some value to you and can assit in your further study of this phenomenon. Yours truly, J.Y. Simpson. 3rd. Officer. I would just like to add to the above report that although I have witnessed "White Water" on previous occasions I have never seen such an extensive display as this. The vessel spent four hours sailing through this strange phenomenon some 45 miles. P.F. Redfern. Master.	Letter to Dr. Herring	Arabian Sea	Milky Sea	0	N/A	224

At 2130 it was noticed that the horizon was no longer visible and a few minutes later again became visible but now the sea was much ligher than the sky. This was thought at first to be the reflection of the ships lights in some restricted visibility but on switching off the light the glow was still present. The glow increased in intensity and by 2000 the whole sea was glowing evenly and sufficiently brightly to obscure the breaking wave crest, and ships wake. The glow continued with varying intensity until 0100Z when it finally disappeared.	Letter to Dr. Herring	Oman	Milky Sea	0	N/A	226

It seemed to be resonant with the ship's propeller. Also within the flat calm sea there were frequent pin points of electric blue light.	Miller et al. 2021	Gulf of Thailand	Milky Sea	0	N/A	227

The sea ahead of the vessel had an illuminated appearance as the vessel neared the area, which appeared to be stretching to the horizon on either side of the vessel. The phenomena became more pronounced. The sea having a milky white colour the cloud cover was 8/8 stratocumulus with no moon so reflection was ruled out. The vessel continued to pass through the phenomena for 3/4 of an hour during which time samples were taken of the water, though the samples do not give off any illuminated nor was the water discoloured in any way. The phenomena sloowly faded out At 0415Z. Visibility was approx 12 miles.

During the above times the vessel encountered an usual example of bioluminescence taking the form of "white" or "milky" water. The bioluminescence appeared ahead of the vessel. (Approximately One Mile) and its inital appearance was that of shallow mist stretching from the vessel to the horizon on either side. However once the vessel had entered the bioluminescence patch it became apparent as to the type of phenomenon we were witnessing. Upon entry into the bioluminescent area the radar was switched on but this made no apparent difference to the luminescence. Or to the general nature of the phenomeon. Nor did its appearance change noticeably during the duration of the observation. One very noteable feature was the appearance of the sky and clouds during the transit which prior to encountering the bioluminescence was relatively light, however once the sea surface became affected the sky and clouds appeared to be almost black in contrast with the water giving an indication as to the luminosity of the bioluminescence.

Kris Kimmons, US Navy	One night the surface of the sea was phosphorescing brilliantly enough you could read (barely) on the bridge. The extent of the phenomenon was from horizon to horizon. Of note, we were working with a pilot who reported he was seeing it from horizon to horizon as well at 1000 feet. (The sea surface) had a very diffused look. The spray (~15-20 kts blowing and ~3 foot chop) was phosphorescing as well so the surface looked like a soft fuzzy blanket. The light from the surace of the sea was brighter than full moonlight.

At about 2225 Z, a whitish glow was observed on the horizon and after 5 minutes steaming the ship was completely surrounded by a sea of a milky-white colour, which was emitting an even uniform glow similar to that of a flourescent strip light held just under the surface of the water. The intensity of the light produced by this bioluminescence was similar to that produced by a full moon on a clear night. Around the vessel patches of sea could be observed that were darker in color and no bioluminescence was present. The white colour of the sea could be broken up by the vessel's bow wave.

Between the hours of 1500-1700Z, the vessel passed through an extensive area of bioluminescence believed to be the form 'white water.' The phenomenon was first observed by the first officer (Mr. R. Basford) who summoned the Chief Officer for a second opinion. The phenomenon was subsequently observed by 14 officers of all ranks and although 'white water' is believed to be common in the area, none of the observing officers had seen it before. The white water took the form of a constant milky white glow covering the entire sea surface, and was sufficient to illuminate the undersides of the small amounts of cumulus present at the time. Had the horizon not been clearly visible the white water could have been mistaken for a type of fog. Visibility was in fact excellent, confirmed by radar and visual observation of a ship 10 miles away. A sample of the water was taken by rubber bucket, but attempts to stimulate the same bioluminescence reaction in a glass by stirring and shaking met without success. The sea temperature was 26.3 deg C and the air temperature was 26.9 deg C. The wind was southwesterly force 3 having abated in the previous 4 hours from a force 6. Initial Observers: R.

Locality: Arabian Sea, Latitude 10 deg N, Longitude 62 deg E/ As prevalent in the Arabain Sea during this time of year, in the above period of approximately twenty minutes, the phenomena of bioluminescence was observed at a very high intensity and thereafter for four to five hours, gradually decreasing in intensity. During the above period the whole sea surface to the hoirzon was observed as a uniform, brilliant white glow, similar to what is recognized as a "milky sea." To note in particular, just prior to this twenty period, the sea surface showed no indication of bioluminescence of any type, and the rate at which its appearance changed contrast from dark to a brilliant white was only a period of several seconds.

The air smelt of fish and the air temperature was noticably cool, the 2/O mistook the phenomena as sea smoke, which in fact it looked like. (Possibly the luminescence in the air above the sea surface mentioned in Met 0887). The entire surface of the sea was glowing as though lit from beneath and uniformally Milk White as per the Marine Observer Handbook (Met 0887). The v/hs wake and wash showed no increase in brightness. The sea appeared calm but the wind speed was estimated at 12 knots. No large sealife was observed. On leaving the area of 'white water' a very marked contrast was noted between said white water and black normal colour, the line being very nearlt straight with some distortion - (The bioluminescence appeared to cover the entire sea surface horizon to horizon.)

The initial observation was of 'speckles' running along the ship's side and in the bow waves, these appeared to be caused by the direct disturbance of the water by the vessel. This was observed for several minutes before the vessel entered an area of 'patchy', seemingly 'milky sea', where the water emitted a diffuse glow. It was noticed that the wind was blowing the luminescence in 'slicks' which could be seen to be qutie distant from the ship. Although unable to gauge how extensive the phenomena was, it appeared to stretch half-way to the horizon, and certainty did not appear to be triggered by the ship's movement, as the area of phenomena could be seen approaching and then disappearing astern. The ship's sea track caused quite a distinctive glowing wake and the 'speckles and patches' which were first observed, continued through the encounter and for several mintues after. It was interesting to note that the local speckled luminescence was quite sharp and distinct to the eye as opposed to the more remote 'milky/patchy' sea phenomena which produced an even diffuse glow in the surface water.

Windy Thoughts sailed into a sea that was literally alight from horizon to horizon with a bright luminous green glow as far as the eye could see. Amazingly, the sky around us was aglow as well. All was dead quiet, the wind and seas calmed considerably. And yet our speed increased as Windy Thoughts sailed along in silence, not a sound of a wave breaking on her hull, not even the sound of the bow wave as she cut through the water---and not a whisper of wind was heard.

Once the bioluminescence reached full intensity the horizon was totally overwhelmed and no visible horizon was visible at any point for the next 20/30 minutes. The bioluminescence took no form that anyone had ever seen trying to describe the type of luminescense is very hard to describe. As the swell rose and fell, the bioluminescence had the same [????] as the swell. [Drawing of two waves out of phase such that the peaks of one align with the troughs of the other] Apparent view from the sea level the swell waves also approxiamte colour of bioluminescenes. The bioluminescence appeared to well up from the sea. The master took a sample of the sea using the sea bucket, and once the bucket was clear of the sea the bioluminescence died and faded into nothing. At the time of maximum intensity, the bioluminescence was so bright that no other waves could be seen. It then took thirty minutes for the bioluminescence to fade to dark. The sea then took on a totally normal appearance. Later during the night a bioluminescence trail was left by the vessel.	Letter to Dr. Herring	Strait of Hormuz	Milky Sea	0	N/A	252

SM1	Wednesday 3rd August 1994 1750 GMT Ships Posn 06 deg 21'N 78 deg 00'E. An extremely large patch of bioluminescence was encountered which first of all seemingly thought to large fishng fleet. The was was about nine to ten miles across and was approximately 5 miles deep in thick patches. It was observed that it carried on in a north-westerly direction. The luminescence was stretched EAST-WEST by the wind which was approx westerly force 4, and was extremely bright in nature. On studying the narine observers handbook it was determined it could be one of two types: (a) the diffused white light, which may give enough light to read by, or to illuminate clouds which is called "white water" or "milky sea". The even glow is thought to be light from marine organisms of microscopic size. (b) The upwelling of subsurface water, breaking into vivid luminosity at the surface.

Within 20 minutes an uncanny inversion had taken place, the sky appearing black against the luminous bright white of the sea; wash and wake became invisible and the sea had noticably quietened, although wind speed had non substantially changed.

Prior to making the observed it was assumed that lights from the ship were giving the grey-green appearance to the haze just above the surface of the sea. However, due to the S.W. monsoon the sea had been rough for several days and the wind was up to that time about force 6. A further observation was made from the port side to ensure that the sidelight was not making a colour change that side, and sure enough it was still a luminous grey-green glow all around the ship for as far as the eye could see. Just to make double sure it was not light from the ship, I turned off all extermall accommodation lighting except the navigation lgihts and the glow remained. I called the captain who also remarked that he had never experienced this phenomena before. the opinion was that it looked like a vast area covered by underwater lights, similar to a swimming pool however no standard bioluminescence had been seen before the obs, and one at the time either. At the end of the watch the effect was still there but weakening, and it was of the opinion of the bridge team that we had entered the "Twilight Zone".

On a clear blue sky night no moon, 150 miles east of somalian coast, a whitish glow was observed on the horizon and after 15 minutes teaming the ship was completely surrounded by a sea of milky white colour with fairly uniform luminescence. The bioluminescence appeared to cover the entire sea surface, horizon to horizon above the surface. Appeared as if sailing over a field of snow or gliding over the clouds. There was no damping effect on capillary waves or reduction of visibility at all. No mist at deck level although at distance it appeared either low lying mist or the upwelling of luminescence itself. The bow waves and the wake appeared blackish, the thick black patches of oil slicks were passing by, later the aldis lamp revealed that the patches were actually the light green kelp, amazingly appeared black in the white waters. (Unable to collect the sample). On close examination of the water sample by magnifying glass, many single cell milky jelly fish like micro organism was observed some of them were large enough to be detected by naked eye. However there was no luminescence as such. One very tiny shrimp like crustacean was also found about 3mm long. The sample is retained, but we are afraid we havn't got any preservtives onboard. There was no significant change in temperatures or weather during the six hours after which the luminescence gradually disappeared as the moon rose.

At 1800 UTC whilst the vessel was on a heading of 041 deg at 22 knots luminescence was observed in the form of large milky or steaky patches 5-10 m wide and 2-3 m long. It was so intense at times that it affected the Lookout's night vision. On closer inspection, it was discovered that the milky patches had an orange tint to them which led to the conclusion that they contained large shoals of krill which were feeding on plankton. Also present was a strong smell similar to freshly-cut grass left on the compost heap for a few days. The phenomenon persisted throughout the hours of darkness until daybreak, the display showing the greatest quantity and intensity ever seen by the observer. Luminescence was present throughout the leg of the voyage from Pusan to Japan and was even seen in the Japanese ports of Kobe, Nagoya and Yokohama but the luminosity was not as intense when compared with the earlier observation. At the time of the first sighting the sea temperature was 18.5 deg and the wind was NNE'ly, force 1-2. Position of ship: 22 deg 29.2'N, 123 deg 22.7'E.

(Although the wind was constant). The whole area displayed a bright off white light (Almost milky in colour) and it appeared to be from horizon to horizon. Our first guess was a low mist, but the wind strength did not support this. Bioluminescence came to mind next and then was agreed upon between myself and my watchman. However the distrubed wake of the vessel was darker than that which surrounded the vessel, which was bright enough to cause a very defined silhouette of the ship and carge and almost bright enough to read by. The general area was bright for about 25 mins (8 1/2 miles) and then darkened slightly for 10 minutes before the vessel left the phenomena.	Letter to Dr. Herring	Arabian Sea	Milky Sea	0	N/A	260

The presence of the bioluminescence gave an appearance which resembled a sea of milk or cloud. The effect was distinguishable to the extent that the normal appearance of a dark sea and lighter sky was reversed to give a 'luminous sea' and a dark sky. Also the ships wake and distrubed water up to approx 1 meter from the ship's side was noticed to be slightly more luminous than the rest of the sea (as if the vessel was passing through a continuous sea of phosphorescence.) All this gave an intriguing appearance, as if a high intensity search light was emmitting its bean upwards from the sea bottom. Illuminating the sea water as it would normally illuminate clouds (however, once clear of the sea surface the light no nlonger illuminated the medium of air.). Additional Comment: This is now the 4th time I have observed this phenomena on board this vessel over 3 years. Previously this has occurred in the southern or middle section of the Banda Sea Area similar conditions prevailing but the intensity of the bioluminescence varied from a brilliant white (almost gloss white) to a dirty off white. Previously it was assumed that this was a well documented phenomena which we now notice is not the case. Hence we weill in future report all cases.

It was not ordinary bioluminescence - I grew up in Norway and had seen that thousands of times before -- it was a white, light, glowing ocean around us as far as we could see. The phenomenon didn't last very long, maybe an hour or two if I recall correctly. We definitely sailed into it. We also sailed out of it - the light didn't go out, it wasn't dawn, we just left the area where the ocean was lit. We do not remember any dark wake. I think we would have remembered it if we had seen it- as it would have been the opposite of most "normal" bioluminescence, where the wake is glowing.

No moon, cloudy above, so no stars either, why did the world seem to be glowing? The light gradually grew stronger, and it became clear that it was coming from the water. The whole sea around us seemed to be thick and opaque like milk, and was emitting a greenish-blue light. This was not your typical bioluminescence that is little sparkles of light caused by disturbances in the water. This was a constant glow that stretched from horizon to horizon. Within this overwhelming glow would occasionally float past large (tubular) pieces of solid material that glowed even brighter than the rest, and when I attempted to catch them in a bucket or with a gaff hook they would just break apart like clumps of dirt. We floated in (this) sea for over three hours, and everyone was in disbelief at what we were seeing, and then suddenly we could see a line of black water ahead, and as quickly as it had started we passed out of (it), but for a little while still we could see an eerie glow behind us.

Abdul Hafid	[ This account is based on an interview done by the Biosphere Foundation's crew aboard the vessel Mir while visiting Dungkean, Indonesia in 2024 with local fishermen. The Biosphere foundation provided an english translation of the interview and that is what is inscribed here as well as an interview summary. The full interview can be found here: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gFCk-OnHViM ] [ Summary: Approximately 7 years ago, August, first time they saw something like this; while like milk at sea, as far as the light from the flashlight all he can see is white, No moon (in new moon), duration: 1 hour, 300 meters depth. ] I want to share a particular experience I had near here while at sea. In between the peninsula and reef Merpati. It started around 6pm and I had already turned on the light on my boat. One of my friends was in the FAD (fish attracting device) a wooden raft with a hut build on top of it. One of my other friends was in the back of the boat while I was in the front. When my friend (on the back of the boat) stood up and went to pee, he noticed that the sea had turned completely white. Then he asked me "sir, what is this?" When I saw this, I stopped moving. The elders of the village say this type of activity is a 'Sea Ghost' and it can take on many different forms. They believe that these ghosts can be things such as: a solitary puffer fish, a giant octopus or a white ocean, etc. So when we saw the ocean had turned white we decided to just wait and stay still, after an hour the white had disappeared.
